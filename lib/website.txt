Orlando Sanford International Airport Specifies Siloxa-Tek 8500 for Parking Deck Repairs


						
							
								Project managers performed a mockup of various waterproofing sealers, including the Siloxa-Tek 8500. A high actives, water based sealer was specified to avoid any adverse reactions with the parking lot joints. It was unanimously concluded that the Siloxa-Tek 8500 was the best product for the project. 
							
								
								Property managers of the Orlando Sanford International Airport were experiencing water intrusion on the top deck of the main parking garage. Water was leaking down through the concrete onto the decks below, causing structure deterioration and damage to vehicles.The Ghostshield products are FAA approved and have been used on several other airports around the world, including the Roland Garros Airport in Sainte-Marie, Réunion, Boston-Logan International Airport, and Chicago O’Hare International Airport.Orlando Sanford International Airport  is located in Sanford, Florida near Orlando. It was originally built as a Naval Air Station, and today serves as an international airport.
								Why Ghostshield?
								SILOXA-TEK 8500 is an industrial-grade, water-based, high actives, Department of Transportation approved, silane/siloxane engineered to reduce water and moisture intrusion, while protecting concrete and masonry substrates from chlorides and deicing salts.

How to Protect Concrete Countertops


						
							
								We have all been there, that time you were on your third glass of wine and the bottle looked a little closer than it was leaving a permanent red stain on the island. From spilled lemonade to splashes of tomato sauce, if left unsealed concrete countertops are highly exposed and at risk. Continue reading to learn how to protect concrete countertops with a concrete countertop sealer.

							
								
								With all the time and investment you have made into installing the concrete countertops of your dreams, you are at the point where you want a concrete sealer that is nearly maintenance free and can stand up to almost anything spilled on it. Despite concrete’s strong and resilient appearance, it is extremely porous and susceptible to staining from acids, oils and wine immediately upon contact.In order to protect the concrete countertops it is essential that you seal them with a concrete countertop sealer as soon as possible. Concrete countertops are constantly in use and exposed to household staining and water penetration so reapplication of the concrete countertop sealer is required. Manage your expectations: Penetrating sealers are great for keeping the natural beauty and appearance of the concrete itself but they do require a maintenance plan. Always remember to take great care and clean up any spills in a timely manner. As with any sealer, always use a cutting board and don’t cut directly on the concrete countertop.Penetrating sealers are great for keeping the natural look and texture of the concrete but require some additional maintenance and more frequent reapplication. For extra protection use a concrete countertop wax which will protect the concrete countertops from additional staining.
								Why Ghostshield?
								High Gloss Durable Concrete Coating:While looking for a stain proof, zero maintenance concrete sealer may be unrealistic from a penetrating concrete sealer, a concrete coating such as the POLYASPARTIC 745 is one of the most durable options out there. The Polyaspartic 745 is a concrete coating that stands up to anything you can spill on it, every time.Natural Finish Concrete Sealer:The glossy, color darkening qualities of the Polyaspartic 745 are not for everyone. If more of a natural finish is desired the concrete COUNTERTOP SEALER 880 is the best option. (If you prefer a water based version use the COUNTERTOP SEALER 770). Although it is a penetrating concrete sealer, it gives you time to clean up spills before they are able to penetrate into the concrete countertop, especially oily based substances. Use with a concrete countertop wax for additional stain resistance and protection.Low Sheen Concrete Sealer:If you are looking for a sheen that is in between, the concrete COUNTERTOP SEALER 660 is a great alternative with its not too shiny, not too matte finish.

Water Repellents


						
							
							
								
								Water is one of nature’s most powerful elements.  It’s forceful enough to make its way into some of the most solid materials.  Take for instance concrete.  Even though concrete is tough, concrete is porous just like a sponge.  Water can cause a lot of damage to concrete if the concrete is not sealed or not sealed properly.  Let’s go over the damage water can cause and what can be done to protect concrete against this agile element.If water penetrates concrete and freezes, it breaks off small flakes from the surface of the concrete. If you live in a part of the country where deicing salts are used, that breakage may be even worse.  This breakage is known as scaling.  Concrete that’s been exposed to freezing and thawing in the presence of moisture and/or deicing salts is affected the most by scaling.  Another problem that can happen when water enters concrete is that it forces the surface to peel.  This is called spalling.  Spalling happens when there is moisture present in the concrete.  This can be common in basements. In addition to spalling, sometimes pitting will occur.  Pitting can sometimes look a lot like spalling but there is a difference.  Pitting creates small, deep holes that have a rugged edge.  Pitting can be caused if the concrete wasn’t mixed properly.  Sometimes even the age of the concrete can be a factor of pitting.  Cracking may be the most familiar imperfection when it comes to concrete.  Cracking can’t be prevented but it can be controlled.  There are a few reasons why cracking may occur in concrete: There may have been excess water in the concrete mix when it was being prepared.  When there’s a lot of water in the concrete mix, it takes away from the concrete's strength.  Cracks can form from extreme temperature change while the concrete was drying, and climate’s where freezing and thawing take place could eventually see cracks in concrete as well.  A good water repellent will help to prevent and protect concrete from all the issues mentioned above.  Water repellents help reduce water, vapor, and moisture intrusion into concrete.  A product that is a blend of silane/siloxanes will make for a great penetrating sealer.  This formula works by creating a hydrophobic barrier which doesn’t allow water to penetrate the concrete.  The water ends up sitting on the surface, resulting in a water beading effect.  The silane/siloxanes protect from the inside out, capable of impregnating the concrete from the surface and internally lining the concrete with the sealer. It lines the concrete but doesn’t fill it, making the surface breathable.  A solvent based sealer can emit strong vapors and care should be taken, especially if using them indoors.  A water based repellent will have a lower VOC content than a solvent based repellent, so less chemical odor.  Both solvent and water based repellents will help protect concrete against water intrusion.  Our Siloxa-Tek 8510 is an industrial-grade, solvent-based, water repellent.  The lifespan of a solvent-based repellent will be longer than a water-based water repellent.  Siloxa-Tek 8510 will repel water and salt.  This is a great penetrating sealer that will also restrict oil and protect against staining.  If you’re leaning more toward a water-based water repellent, Siloxa-Tek 8505 is a great choice.  This industrial-grade, water repellent will still prevent water and salt intrusion along with oil and stain protection.  One of our favorite products to treat nearly any application is Siloxa-Tek 8500.  This industrial-grade, water-based repellent is a preferred choice for those that live in a climate where a freeze-thaw cycle occurs. Along with its salt and water repelling elements, this is a great choice for driveways and garages.The damage that water can cause to concrete is undeniable.  Using a water repellent to safeguard the life of your concrete is ideal to get the most out of any concrete surface or structure.

Arkansas State University Fowler Auditorium Waterproofing Project


						
							
								When a sealer was specified for the Fowler Auditorium, the Iso-Tek 8501 was the only choice due to its innovative gel formulation and surpassed ability to seal vertical applications.

							
								
								ASU’s Fowler Auditorium building was experiencing moisture intrusion and a solution was needed that would prevent the building from absorbing water. Ghostshield Iso-Tek 8501 had been used at ASU the year prior to seal the Dean B. Ellis library with impressive results.“We worked with Ghostshield on the ASU library project last year; during application of the Iso-Tek 8501 a hydraulic fluid hose broke spraying the wall of the building.   It was noticeably evident that the Iso-Tek 8501 product was working. The areas that had been treated had the hydraulic fluid beading up whereas the parts of the wall that had not yet been treated absorbed the fluid requiring time consuming and costly removal.  The immediate protection that the Ghostshield product offered gave the University and myself peace of mind that we had chosen the best product. We had no hesitation in using Ghostshield for the Fowler Auditorium project. The proof was in the pudding”-Petree Buford, Project Manager Arkansas State UniversityArkansas State University is a public research university and is the flagship campus of the Arkansas State University System, the state's second largest college system and second largest university by enrollment.
								Why Ghostshield?
								ISO-TEK 8501 is the pinnacle of liquid-engineered vertically-applied sealers. The thixotropic gel viscosity defies gravity, bridging the time of contact and degree of saturation gap that has perplexed some of the largest engineering firms globally.

How to Use a Concrete Countertop Wax


						
							
								Concrete wax is a simple and cost-effective way to add an additional wear layer of protection on a concrete countertop or concrete table. Continue reading to learn how to use a concrete countertop wax as well as additional care and maintenance tips to keep your concrete countertop stain free.
							
								
								Whether you are renovating a rustic farmhouse or an industrial loft, concrete countertops are one of the most popular and cost-effective alternatives, fast outpacing granite as the countertop of choice. Countertops are one of the most used areas of the kitchen, with constant exposure to staining, (ie: red wine, coffee, oil and lemon). Using a concrete countertop sealer will combat these issues and help to protect the countertop from everyday spills. You will want to reseal your concrete countertops every six months to one year since abrasive cleaners and every day use can damage the sealer.Take it one step further and use a concrete wax in conjunction with a concrete countertop sealer to add an additional wear layer of protection from scratching, staining and heat. Or if you are looking to take the natural finish of your concrete countertop up a notch use a countertop wax to deeper colors and increase the sheen. Wax countertops monthly once sealed to protect and beautify the surface finish while enhancing the sealer beneath. Care and Maintenance Tips:Wax monthly, or more frequently in higher use areasSeal countertops every 6 months - 2 years depending on useUse cutting boards Clean up spills quickly Stay away from abrasive cleanersStay away from abrasive cleaners: Clean sealed and waxed countertops with mild soap and water. No citrus of vinegar based products should be used. (Organic does not always mean mild and can include citrus ingredients that you’ll want to avoid.

Brick Sealer


						
							
							
								
								Bricks are one of the oldest known building materials dating back to 7000BC where they were first found in the middle east. Today bricks are one of the most common building materials used on residential homes, commercial buildings and decorative surfaces. Bricks are composed of a mixture of water, clay and shale. Today bricks are usually artificially hardened by burning them and putting them in kilns somewhere between 1000 and 1200 degrees F.When purchasing a home, one of the main attractions of the home is the appearance. If a house has no curb appeal, it is going to be harder to market and sell. Bricks are known to be one of the most appealing features to the exterior of a house. To keep the bricks in excellent condition they need to be protected. In order to protect bricks from harsh elements it is best to seal them with a silane/siloxane blended sealer like Ghostshield Siloxa-Tek 8500. This sealer will not only protect the bricks from organic growth and efflorescence but it will reduce water and moisture intrustion. Since water can easily penetrate brick, Siloxa-Tek 8500 would be your best option especially if you are looking for a natural finish. (The sealer will arrive as a milky white liquid but it will dry clear.)

Best Basement Waterproofing Sealer


						
							
							
								
								While concrete may seem like an extremely strong building material, it is naturally porous and prone to water absorption. Beginning on the surface, concrete is filled with tiny pores and hairline cracks that extend throughout the material. While concrete may seem strong enough without any treatment, it is not as strong and protected as it can be. The tiny pores of a concrete slab and foundation can absorb water if not treated with a waterproofing concrete sealer. Basements are one of the most vulnerable areas of a home since they are at high risk of flooding, excessive mold and mildew build-up and the passage of radon gases. Since most basements are comprised of either concrete cinderblock walls or poured foundations without the proper insulation they are at high risk of the aforementioned.The best way to remediate and prevent water absorption is to use a waterproofing concrete sealer. When looking for a basement waterproofing concrete sealer it is best to look for a penetrating sealer that will leave an invisible finish without the risk of peeling, flaking and delamination. For concrete blocks and cinderblocks the best sealer to use is the Siloxa-Tek 8500. The 8500 product is a surface applied, invisible, non-film forming protection system, that can very effectively increase the water repellency of concrete. Through the use of nano technology the active ingredients seal the pores within the substrate adequately blocking moisture while still maintaining the concretes ability to breathe.For preventatively sealing basement floors and foundation walls the best sealer to use is the Lithi-Tek 9500. The 9500 product is a hybrid densifying, impregnating sealer used to densify, harden and prevent water from penetrating the concrete. Once impregnated the reaction process from the active silicate ingredient produces additional C-S-H (calcium silicate hydroxide) within the capillary tracts thus increasing the density and volumetric mass. The change of the surface tension elicited from the waterproofing component forms a repellent cross-linking membrane that is completely invisible, hydrophobic and able to repel water.For sealing basement floors and foundation walls that are actively experiencing moisture issues it is best to use a two step process. Use the Lithi-Tek 4500  first as a primer, wait 7 days and then apply the Siloxa-Tek 8500 as a top coat. The combination of the two products is the best combination to lock out moisture, prevent efflorescence and resist mold and mildew.

How to Waterproof Concrete


						
							
							
								
								When concrete and mineral substrates come into contact with water, they absorb an amount which depends on their porosity. Water is one of the most detrimental causes of structural damage such as cracks, frost damage, algae growth and salt corrosion. Much of this damage can be prevented or significantly reduced through the use of Siloxa-Tek 8500. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 is an invisible, non-film-forming sealer of mineral substrates that inhibits long term water absorption while remaining breathable.Due to the special penetration effect, Siloxa-Tek 8500 permanently protects concrete against moisture from rain, dew or snow, against road salts and microorganisms. In addition, the nano technology used in the Siloxa-Tek 8500's formula help regulate concretes water balance, which increases the lifespan of the mineral substrate.Other advantages include:Prevention from freeze-thaw attack and ASR by preventing the ingress of water.Prevents further damage to reinforced concrete by limiting the substrate water content, chloride and other aggressive salts.Provides increased protection as a hydrophobic barrier to prevent future penetration of water and soluble aggressive agents through a crack.Provides protection from spalling and pitting as a result of aggressive salts and chlorides.Alkali resistant.Freeze-thaw/de-icing salt resistant.UV resistant.Reduces vapor transmission.Water beading (water repellent effect).Reduction of dirt pick-up.Reduces risk of efflorescence.Protection against micro-organism growthEffective penetration depth.Seals pores and capillaries while remaining breathable.No change in appearance of the substrate; the treated surface does not become glossy.Tack free, durable finish.No formation of harmful by-products.Low VOCsEasy to Apply.DOT approved

How to Acid Etch Concrete


						
							
							
								
								In order to properly prepare a substrate to accept a concrete sealer one of the best surface preparation methods is to acid etch the concrete. Acid etching will open up the pores of the concrete and allows the new concrete sealer to properly adhere. Acid etching is much less labor intensive than grinding the concrete but proper safety precautions should be taken.Muriatic acid is the type of acid that is typically used for etching concrete. Ghostshield's Hydro-Etch 1000 is a specialized muriatic acid and phosphoric acid blend which has less fumes than regular muriatic acid and is used to clean concrete, brighten concrete and etch concrete. Before etching you want to make sure everything is removed from the surface you are including cars and furniture. Sweep up the area to remove as much dust and dirt as possible.Follow basic safety precautions by wearing long sleeves, gloves, eye protection and a face mask to protect from fumes. Acid is generally mixed at a ratio of 3 parts water to 1 part acid for sufficient strength to etch properly.  Ideally you want to test the strength needed first before doing the entire floor.  You can do this by first mixing a small solution in your watering can starting at a 5:1 ratio.  Apply it to a small area of wet concrete.  It should begin bubbling and fizzing immediately.  If not then you will want to increase the strength accordingly.  Sometimes a ratio stronger than 3:1 may be needed for particularly dense concrete or a smooth power troweled floor.Caution!  Always add acid to water, not water to acid.  If you pour water into acid it can cause an explosive reaction that can spray you with the mixture and burn your skin!Before acid etching, make sure the concrete is free of all oil, contaminants, grease, and dirt.  Contrary to what many people think, acid will not clean grease and oil spots.  In fact, if these areas have not been cleaned and degreased properly, the acid solution will just sit on top and not react with the concrete.Dampen the concrete: Use your hose to lightly spray down the concrete in your garage so that the concrete is wet but not puddling water.  If you have a large floor, you may want to acid etch in sections.  Do not let the concrete dry out before or during application of the acid solution.Apply the acid solution: Use the 2 gallon plastic watering container to sprinkle the acid solution on the concrete.  This will spread the solution evenly without much splashing.  Do not just pour it on the concrete.  This will create an inconsistent spread of the acid solution and will not provide for a uniform result.  The 2 gallon container works well because you can mix 1.5 gallons of water to .5 gallons of acid for a 3:1 ratio.  You can use any size you like however, as long as you mix the ratio of acid to water correctly.  1 gallon of acid solution will cover approximately 50 – 70 square feet of garage floor.Scrub the acid solution: Once the solution is applied, lightly scrub it into the concrete with a push broom or long handled scrub brush.  This helps to create a uniform etch of the concrete.  Let the solution sit from 2 – 15 minutes while it continues to fizz and bubble.  Do not let the floor dry out during this process.  Add more solution if necessary.Neutralize: Mix 4 cups of baking soda to 1 gallon of water in your large 5 gallon bucket and pour it into the now empty watering container. Or use 4 ounces of household ammonia to 1 gallon of water. Sprinkle your neutralizing solution over the part of the floor that was acid etched and let it sit for a minimum of 10 minutes.  When time is up, rinse the neutralized solution with your hose into a drain or out the garage (if local water codes allow it).  Another method is to use a wet vac and then dispose of the solution according to your local codes. Check the surface of the concrete at this time.  It should feel similar to medium grit sand paper with a uniform texture.  If not, you will need to repeat the process again.Final rinse: Once the initial neutralizing solution is cleaned up, it is important to thoroughly flush and rinse the remaining solution out of the concrete multiple times.  It can leave a white powdery residue on your floor once dried (called calcium carbonate) if you do not do this.  This is a fine dust that will not allow your coating to adhere properly.  Use a high pressure nozzle while thoroughly scrubbing the concrete with your scrub brush.  You can introduce a mild solution of Simple Green at this point if you like.  Just make sure it is thoroughly rinsed. Using a pressure washer at this point works well also.  Do not use a pressure washer to rinse off the initial neutralizing solution however.  It can drive any acid solution that had not been neutralized yet deeper into the concrete and cause problems later.pH test your rinse water: After your final rinse, dab a pH test strip onto the still wet floor to check the pH.  Anything between 6.0 and 9.0 will work for most coatings with 7.0 (neutral) being ideal.  If it’s below 6.0 then the water is indicating that acid residue is still in the pores of the concrete.  Rinse some more and repeat the test until you get the results you want.Further Tips for Acid Etching ConcreteIt’s a good idea to cover anything that you don’t want to get splashed with a plastic drop cloth.  Don’t acid etch the concrete if the temps are below 50 degrees as the acid will not be as effective with the cooler temperatures.Also, make sure your floor has dried thoroughly before applying a concrete sealer.  Fans will help.  Give it at least two days with warm weather and longer if it’s humid or cooler.  Though the surface may be dry, the pores of the concrete can still contain moisture and escape through outgassing when the temperatures rise during the day.  This will cause your coating to not properly adhere.  You can always do a quick moisture test with plastic if you are not sure.

Concrete Surface Preparation


						
							
							
								
								Concrete coatings typically fail due to inadequate surface penetration or moisture. In order for a coating to properly adhere, the concrete surface must be free of surface defects, clean, sound and dry. The surface also needs to have a rough surface porosity in order to establish a good bond between the coating and the concrete. Failure to prepare the surface usually results in adhesion failure and premature delamination.Before applying an epoxy or urethane coating take the following steps to ensure optimal performance:Prepare the surface by cleaning, repairing defects and testing the surface for soundness. Remove any and all contaminants debris, oil, dirt, grease, efflorscence, previous sealers and coatings.Mechanically scarify or acid etch the concrete surface. Mechanically abrading the concrete surface will alter the surface profile of the concrete, creating a roughened and textured surface for better coating adhesion. Acid etching can be used in areas where no alternative cleaning methods are possible and if the concrete already has a rough surface profile. Make sure to neutralize the surface after acid etching to ensure the PH of the surface is above 4. The surface should have a profile of at least a CSP 2 - CSP 3.Repair any surface defects and test the surface for dust and moisture. Use the plastic sheet test, calcium chloride test, or a surface moisture meter to ensure the moisture content of the concrete is not too high.Test out the Epoxy 325 or Urethane 645 coating in a small area to check the adequacy of the surface preparation. After the coating has cured check the bond of the coating to ensure it is properly adhering to the surface.

Water Repellent Sealer vs Concrete Restoration


						
							
							
								
								Architects and engineers are currently rediscovering reinforced concrete and its no wonder, since virtually no other construction material offers so many possibilities. However, concrete and steel are vulnerable to harmful substances that penetrate into the building material by means of moisture. The restoration work required to fix the damage is much more expensive than successful prevention with a water repellent sealer. Damage to concrete buildings generates costs that run into billions every year; however, Ghostshield Siloxa-Tek 8500 can put an end to this.Thanks to the special penetration effect, Siloxa-Tek 8500 hydrophobic sealer agents permanently protect concrete against moisture from rain, dew or snow, against road salts and microorganisms. In addition, Siloxa-Tek 8500 helps regulate concretes water balance, which increases the buildings lifespan without unscheduled repair work due to structural damage.Advantages:Water barrier and consequently:Salt barrier  chlorides dissolved in water are blocked (e.g. road salt and sea water)No corrosion  the reinforcing steel does not rust, as no moisture reaches itNo frost damage greater resistance to freeze/thaw cyclesPrevention with Siloxa-Tek 8500 saves costs, energy and resources:Cost- and resource-intensive renovation is avoidedBuildings that have been treated by Siloxa-Tek 8500 have a significantly longer lifespan and thus a low environmental impact over the long termApplications:Hydrophobic impregnation of concreteIntegral water-repellent treatment of concrete

How to Prevent Concrete Damage


						
							
							
								
								Concrete damage can occur through some of the following means:Carbonation: Carbon dioxide from the air can react with the calcium hydroxide in concrete to form calcium carbonate in a process which is called carbonation. Carbonation is a slow and continuous process progressing from the outer surface inward, but slows down with increasing diffusion depth. Carbonatation decreases alkalinity, which is essential for corrosion prevention of reinforcing steel.Chlorides: Chlorides, particularly calcium chloride have been used to shorten the setting time of concrete.However, calcium chloride and sodium chloride have been shown to leach calcium hydroxide and cause chemical changes in Portland cement, leading to loss of strength,as well as attacking the reinforcing steel present in most concrete.Sulfates: Sulfates in contact with concrete can cause chemical changes to the cement, which can cause significant microstructural effects leading to the weakening of the cement binder. Sea Water: Concrete exposed to salt/sea water is susceptible to its corrosive effects. The effects are more pronounced above the tidal zone than where the concrete is permanently submerged. Above the water surface, mechanical damage may occur by erosion by waves themselves or sand and gravel they carry, and by crystallization of salts from water soaking into the concrete pores and then drying up. Sea water corrosion contains elements of both chloride and sulfate corrosion.In order to prevent the aforementioned concrete damages the use of a concrete sealer will help to prevent and protect substrates and extend the life of concrete. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 is an advanced, high performance, industrial strength water based concrete/masonry water repellent solution designed to reduce water and moisture intrusion. The active ingredients seal the pores within the substrate adequately blocking surface moisture while still maintaining the concretes ability to breathe. It will not significantly modify substrate appearance or traction and will only wear away if the concrete surface itself wears away.

Hydrophobic Concrete Sealers


						
							
							
								
								Typical Concrete Damages:Corrosion of Rebar: Rebar is protected by the oxide layer in alkaline concrete. Carbon dioxide reduces concrete's alkalinity from outside to inside by formation of calcium carbonate. At a pH <9.5 the passivated layer fails and the surface corrosion of rebar begins.Chloride Induced Corrosion: Chloride sources are deicing salts or sea water. Chlorides penetrate into concrete with water acting as a transporter. Upon water seepage, pitting, spalling, cracking and corrosion starts.ASR (Alkali Silica Reaction): ASR is the reaction between reactive aggregates and alkalinity catalyzed by alkali (deicing salts). This can result in discoloration, micro cracks, and break up.Salt Blooming & Leaching: Dissolved sulfates chemically attack concrete which leads to pressure build up and cracks. Pure water can leach out calcium slats and leave the surface strongly weathered. Pollutants can penetrate easily into the open pore structure.All of the above damages require water either as a transporter or reactor. Since they all require water, hydrophobic concrete sealers will prevent damages such as: chloride induced corrosion of rebar, carbonation, freeze-thaw damage, alkali silica reaction and gasous pollutants.Repairs to concrete structures cost up to ten times of preventative measures such as the use of a hydrophobic concrete sealer. By using the  Siloxa-Tek 8500 damages to the aforementioned is greatly prevented.

Water Based Water Repellents


						
							
							
								
								Silane, siloxane, and siliconate based water repellents have been used for decades to protect buildings against moisture and consequent physical, chemical and biological deterioration. These silicone based water repellents in comparison to film forming coatings do not seal the surface of concrete and masonry. They instead modify the pores of the substrate such that the absorption of liquid water is suppressed; the pores, however, remain open and water vapor diffusion is not affected.For a long time it was thought that it would not be possible to create storage stable water based water repellents. One of the main demands for these repellents is that they must penetrate well into the substrate. A water based water repellent sealer is surface applied, invisible and very effectively increases the durability of concrete. Due to the small size of the mono-molecular layer, there is little or no change in its aesthetic appearance. Water repellent sealers change the surface tension of mineral substrates and produce a water repellent surface to keep water and aggressive water-soluble salts, such as chlorides and sulfates, out.In structures on and below grade water should generally be kept out and away to prevent damage. The most pervasive form of concrete damage is surface scaling from freeze-thaw. Other forms of damage include alkali-silica reaction (ASR), chemical intrusion and corrosion of steel reinforcements. Siloxa-Tek 8500 can block up to 99% of surface moisture. The active ingredients seal the pores within the substrate adequately blocking surface moisture while still maintaining the concretes ability to breathe. It will not significantly modify substrate appearance or traction and will only wear away if the concrete surface itself wears away.

Silanes Siloxanes and Siliconates


						
							
							
								
								Sealers that are formulated to prevent the ingress of water and chlorides are typically of a silane, siloxane or siliconate carrier that work by changing the surface tension of a substrate. The change in surface tension creates a water repellent barrier to keep water, salt, chlorides and sulfates from penetrating into the concrete.Silanes: Extremely small sized molecules that are highly alkali-resistant and have the ability to penetrate deep into a concrete substrate.Siloxanes: Similar to a silane; however, they are much more complex and cannot penetrate as deep as a silane. They are alkali resistant and can be used on concrete; however, they are much better suited for porous substrates such as brick and stone.Siliconates: The smallest molecule as compared to silanes and siloxanes, therefore they provide the deepest penetration.All three sealers will provide a flat finish with either a water beading or a water sheeting effect. Due to the small size of the nano molecular structures, there is little or no change in aesthetic appearance or the surface. The pores and capillaries are internally lined but not filled ensuring the surface remains fully vapor permeable.KreteTek offers a few sealers based on these technologies: Siloxa-Tek 8500 and Lithi-Tek 9500.The Siloxa-Tek 8500 is a silane/siloxane blended sealer that penetrates deeply and seals concretes capillary tracts and shrinkage cracks. It is able to resist chemical attack, salt degradation, deicing salts and acid rain while protecting from freeze-thaw cycles and protecting reinforcing steel from corrosion.The Lithi-Tek 9500 is a blended silicate/siliconate sealer that impregnates to lock out moisture and reduce water intrusion. It becomes an integral part of the concrete, forming a complete body of strength and durability with 100% of the results occurring below the surface. Effectively resisting hydrostatic pressure and the spread of vapor transmission this sealer densifies and waterproofs in one step.

How to Protect Concrete from Chloride Penetration


						
							
							
								
								Concrete is thought to be a durable and long-lasting building material. However, with the high levels of moisture and alkalinity, if left unprotected, it will begin to deteriorate when exposed to very aggressive environments - especially in areas exposed to severe elements such as salt, humidity, or frequent weather changes. Because of the extreme porosity of concrete, unprotected concrete can absorb water, sodium chloride (salt), carbon dioxide and acid rain, which in time will affect its integrity.Salt can be a hazard to concrete in the form of deicing road salts, or coastal sea salt spray. When there is an ingress of salt, chloride ions are able to penetrate deep into the concrete. Eventually they will accumulate around the reinforcing steel and will thus cause the erosion and decay of the steel, since oxygen and moisture are present. In order to prevent degradation related to salt and salt exposure, it is best to use a silane/siloxane blended sealer like the Siloxa-Tek 8500.Benefits of Siloxa-Tek 8500Protection from chloride penetrationProtection from carbonationProtection of reinforcing steel against corrosionResistance to wind-borne moistureProtection against freeze-thaw cyclesPrevention of the ingress of water while remaining breathableResists chemical attack, salt degradation, deicing salts, acid rain and seawater

How to Prevent Concrete Corrosion


						
							
							
								
								Concrete has two arch enemies: water-soluble salts and gases. Although concrete is a cost effective building material and extremely durable it can be damaged by water soluble salts and gases. Concrete damage almost always involves moisture and although water is important in making concrete, it can also be extremely destructive. Furthermore it carries aggressive substances, such as chlorides from road salts, into the concrete. When road salts come into contact with untreated concrete, it begins to wear and cause the concrete to spall and corrode, commonly attacking and eroding the reinforcing steel. This causes concrete structures to weaken and begin to breakdown.When mineral building materials come into contact with water, they absorb as much as their porosity allows. This causes varied damages including:Organic growth: moss, mold, lichen and algaeChloride induced reinforcing steel corrosionChemical corrosionDirt pick up and stainsEfflorescence and salt damageFrost damage and freeze/thaw damageShrinkage and swelling cracksHow do you prevent this type of damage from attacking your concrete? By using the Siloxa-Tek 8500 on high risk concrete in areas of extreme salt and chloride can reduce future repair costs by up to 90%. It is estimated that using a water repellent treatment like the Siloxa-Tek 8500 only costs 10% of extensive renovations needed after concrete is damaged. Not only that, the Siloxa-Tek will help to prevent all of the aforementioned damages including organic growth, chloride ion penetration, chemical corrosion, dirt, staining, efflorescence, salt damage, freeze-thaw damage and premature cracking. When exterior concrete is exposed to areas with harsh winter climates with freezing and thawing and salt use on the roadways the Siloxa-Tek 8500 is the most preventive, cost effective solution.

Concrete Block Wall Sealer


						
							
							
								
								What is the best concrete block wall sealer? Concrete blocks and concrete cinderblocks were once extremely popular as the foundation for basements. But with the extremely porous nature of cinderblocks and concrete blocks, water, moisture and efflorescence problems are extremely common. Today poured foundations with reinforced steel footings have taken over as the basement foundation of choice. However, if your basement is comprised of these concrete blocks there is a solution to seal them and prevent all of these problems from precipitating.Concrete blocks and cinderblocks are especially susceptible to moisture and water seepage and because of their porosity water easily finds it way underneath the surface, sitting in the numerous air pockets to fester and eventually spawn mold, mildew, and other issues. Because of the porous nature of these blocks, small holes and air bubbles force moisture and water through the voids if the block is not properly sealed. Not only that, water can also find its way through the mortar with a lot of water seepage occurring from these areas.Using a silane/siloxane blended sealer like Siloxa-Tek 8500 with its blend of large and small molecular particles, will penetrate the surface and chemically react to form a water repellent barrier. As the barrier is below the surface it will not crack, peel, fade or yellow over time. At least two applications, wet-on-wet are required; by applying two coats versus one heavy application the material is able to penetrate deeper and more evenly.

How to Prevent Concrete from Cracking


						
							
							
								
								Concrete, although it seems like a dense, hard, unbreakable material, it is prone to cracking and degradation.  Cracks can occur in spite of any precautions taken. Before concrete hardens when it is in its plastic state, it is full of water. Upon curing it looses moisture and the shrinking creates stress which can pull the slab apart. When the stress becomes too much for the hardened concrete, the slab will crack to relieve pressure. This is especially common in warmer weather. If too much water was used in the mix, once the excess water evaporates, the slab is left with large voids which make the concrete weaker and prone to cracking. This is commonly known as shrinkage cracking. To combat shrinkage cracking control joints are added into the slab. Control joints are grooves that are tooled into new concrete or sawed into concrete after it reaches its initial set. Control joints create a weak place in the slab so when the concrete shrinks, it will crack on the joint instead of in the slab.Expansion joints on the other hand occur in warm weather when the concrete expands after a freeze-thaw cycle. This causes stresses since the concrete will expand and push towards any object in its path. If there is nothing flexible between the slabs the concrete will be forced to crack to relieve tension. By filling the expansion joints with a flexible material, it will act as a shock to relieve the stress and prevent future cracking. Heaving, settling and overloading are other common types of concrete cracks. Heaving cracks occur after a freeze-thaw cycle when the frozen ground lifts and settles when the ground thaws. If the slab is not free to move with the soil, the slab will crack. Settling cracks occur if there is a void in the ground and the ground continues to settle. Overloading cracks occur when there is excessive weight on top of a slab that is too much for the ground to handle. Spider cracks, and crusting cracks will cause aesthetic damage but do not pose any actual threat to the concrete. Instead they are visually unappealing but do not cause a structural problem.In order to prevent concrete from cracking there are a few methods of remediation:1.) Reinforced concrete: although reinforced concrete can also crack and can cause concrete to crack by restraining shrinkage, if cracks do occur the reinforcement can help hold the slab together.2.) Prime with Lithi-Tek 4500 to densifiy and fortify concrete and protect from premature cracking. Wait seven (7) days and then apply the Siloxa-Tek 8500 as a topcoat sealer. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 will help to mitigate moisture, protect from freeze-thaw cycles and deicing salt degradation that can harmfully erode rebar and result in cracking.

Siloxa-Tek 8500 Advantages


						
							
							
								
								You are probably looking for a sealer for one of two reasons: to preventatively seal new concrete or because your concrete is already experiencing damage and you are trying to prevent additional corrosive damage. Concrete is composed of portland cememt, aggregate and water. Concrete may also be reinforced with steel to increase strength and add durability. Initial strength of concrete is determined by the water to cement ratio. If too much water was used in the mix, there will be an increase in capillary pores and a loss of rigidity. The correct ratios on the other hand will result in additional weathering and aging resistance. If incorrect ratios were used, serious damage can occur within a short time frame.Hydrophobic impregnating sealers will preventatively preserve concrete and masonry against weathering and damage. Repairing unsealed concrete is ten times more expensive than preventatively sealing with a hydrophobic impregnating sealer like the Siloxa-Tek 8500. Damage to concrete most always involves moisture. Although water is an important component in making concrete, it can also be destructive. Water and aggressive substances like chloride and road salts are primary causes for damaged concrete driveways, sidewalks, roads and bridges.There are two types of waterproofing sealing options available. Hydrophobic impregnating sealers and film forming coatings. Film forming coatings and acrylic sealers are at high risk for delamination since they are not breathable and do not allow moisture to pass through. Moreover a damaged film coating can lead to damage since water and salts can easily penetrating through damaged sections. By using the impregnating 8500, protection stems from outstanding water repellency and durability. The 8500 outperforms rival products in its resistnace to physical, chemical and microbiological attack. Impregnation with the 8500 will preserve concrete structures for a longtime.:Reduction in water uptakeChloride barrier is formedRetention of high water vapor permeabilityExtensive penetrationHigh UV ResistanceAlkali ResistanceNatural, non-tacky, non-shiny non-yellowing finishBlocks water to protect concrete from water and moistureBlocks salts and forms a barrier to chlorides and road saltsBlocks corrosion so reinforcing steel does not rust so the concrete can remain in tactBlocks frost damage through highly effective water repellency.

Polished Concrete Sealer


						
							
							
								
								Concrete, while strong and a great choice for many building and aesthetic projects, can often be drab and gray, lacking any visual appeal. While this is not a problem for, say, a basement, if you own a business that features concrete, you probably want it to look more presentable. There are a number of ways to enhance concrete's visual aesthetic, such as decorative floor systems, paint chips, surface sealers, and so on. But if you want to improve the concrete without changing the color, a popular choice is to polish it.Polished concrete typically retains the visual appeal without sacrificing any of its structural integrity. If you use a quality concrete denisifer, it will also remain as slip-resistant as untreated concrete. The sheen of a properly sealed concrete slab can make the otherwise boring interior seem like a more welcoming, sleek place.The process to polish concrete is not difficult to acheieve. First, you need to seal the concrete slab with a densifer, such as Lithi-Tek 4500. This product will penetrate within the concrete to react chemically beneath the surface. These chemical reactions will lead to the production of more calcium silicate hydrate, a mineral already present within the concrete naturally. The addition of more calcium silicate hydrate will help fill in the various cracks and pores that are natural to concrete, by-products of its creation. The extra CSH will densify the material, making it stronger and more resistant to such dangers as cracking.It is necessary to seal the concrete with the Lithi-Tek 4500 because the next step will render that impossible. You will need to polish the concrete waiting at least 7 days after using the Lithi-Tek 4500. This is a relatively straightforward process: The process of polishing involves a concrete floor grinder. Concrete grinders are used to gradually grind down the concrete surface using a combination of metal bond diamond abrasives followed by resin bond diamonds to achieve the desired shine and smoothness.Like sandpaper that comes in different grits or levels of abrasiveness concrete diamond abrasives also come in different grits, starting as low as 16 grit and going as high as 3000 grit. The lower the grit, the coarser and more aggressive the tool will be. Conversely, if you want your polished concrete to have a high shine or high-gloss look, finishing with a 3000 grit will usually provide the best results. The result will be a perfectly flat, polished slab that is already protected from danger due to the application of the densifer, enhancing the visual appeal of any concrete surface.

Decorative Sealers


						
							
							
								
								If you take a moment to look around and focus on exterior construction you will begin to realize the beautiful nature of concrete. Concrete, once known for its gray, dull unsightly appearance, is now polished, stamped and stained.  Producing stunning works of art for the interior or exterior of a home.Polished concrete is becoming more and more popular today and is one of the easiest upgrades for your home or warehouse. When you walk into a large big box home improvement store and you look at the floors, you will notice they are shiny and smooth. When you use a concrete densifier like Lithi-Tek 4500 and then polish the concrete professional polishing equipment this outcome is achieved. Once known only for use in warehouses and industrial spaces it is now gaining popularity in homes on living room and living level floors.Stamped concrete is a textured concrete that uses patterns in order to better resemble other materials, such as brick or wood. Typically used on pool decks, driveways, patios, and other such surfaces stamped decorative concrete is usually sealed with an acrylic based sealer. Acrylic sealers such as Cryli-Tek 5500 and Cryli-Tek 5505 will add a matte shine or a high gloss shine respectively. Not only does this shine enhance the appearance of the decorative concrete but it adds additional water repellency and protection.

Acrylic Sealer for Concrete


						
							
							
								
								Acrylic sealers are surface level sealers designed to bond to the surface of a concrete substrate to offer a comprehensive layer of protection. These sealers are not necessarily the best choice for all concrete applications, being more suited to give decorative finishes to concrete and masonry surfaces. These products come in two forms: solvent-based or water-based. The former typically lasts longer than the latter, though solvent-based sealers are increasingly prohibited by state regulations. Water-based sealers are better for the environment and significantly safer for you to apply and are fast replacing solvent-based sealers for all applications.In contrast to penetrating sealers and densifiers with their smaller particles of sealant, acrylic sealers will not penetrate past the surface of the concrete. Instead, the solution will pool on the surface of the concrete substrate to be spread out evenly during the process of application. After the requisite number of coats have been properly applied, the sealer will dry. Once dried, it will act similar to a raincoat on a human body: water will not be able to seep into the concrete through the acrylic barrier.Cryli-Tek 5500 is a water based acrylic sealer that will leave concrete with a subtle matte finish, gently enhancing the concrete without excessive shine or slipperiness. The Cryli-Tek 5500 works as follows: it contains large particles of chemical sealant suspended in a water-based solution. The larger particles of sealant are important to its functioning, as it needs to remain on the surface of the concrete. The Cryli-Tek 5500 additionally offers excellent slip-resistance, which is especially important if you are sealing concrete pavers that surround, say, a pool deck. If you have decorative concrete whose color you want to preserve in the face of discoloration and damage from the sun, the Cryli-Tek 5500 is the perfect choice  it provides excellent UV resistance and color stability, protecting your concrete from all of the elements and the negative side effects of being exposed to weather.Cryli-Tek 5505 is a solvent based acrylic sealer that will leave concrete with a high gloss, wet look finish, enhancing the colors and textures of concrete, stamped concrete and masonry. The Cryli-Tek 5505 works as follows: it contains large particles of chemical sealant suspended in a solvent-based solution. The larger particles of sealant are important to its functioning, as it needs to remain on the surface of the concrete. The Cryli-Tek 5505 is an excellent choice for patios, stamped concrete driveways and pool decks. Because of the high gloss finish surfaces may become slippery when wet. A slip free additive can be added to the sealer to reduce the slipperiness and add a grit texture to the concrete to aid in slip resistance.

Warehouse Sealer


						
							
							
								
								Warehouses are areas that experience frequent and high-level traffic. This traffic can be foot traffic, as well as traffic from the tires of cars or equipment. Warehouses also have the risk of falling product, which, depending on the product, can cause massive damage. Accordingly, most warehouses are constructed from concrete, one of the strongest, most durable man-made materials on the planet.Concrete, however, is not immune to deterioration or damage from either the elements or from high traffic. While concrete is incredibly strong, it is no match for chemical spills, constant traffic from machinery or vehicles, and the elements. Over time, the concrete will crack, spall, and crumble, deteriorating and leading to future problems.Fortunately, using a concrete sealer on the concrete will greatly increase the longevity, strength, and reliability of the concrete. Warehouses especially need this extra guarantee, due to the conditions involved.  Concrete in a warehouse that has not been treated with a concrete sealer will likely not last as long as it should. Repairs to concrete can be costly as well, which makes concrete sealers an extremely cost-effective measure.The sealer you choose for a warehouse floor is going to depend on the desired finish. If you are looking for a natural finish product we would recommend the Siloxa-Tek 8510 The Siloxa-Tek 8510 is a penetrating, impregnating sealer that will repel salts, water and staining from oils and grease. It leaves a completely non-slip surface that looks the same after sealing as it does prioir to sealing. If you are looking for more of a coating the best combination of products to use would be the Epoxy 325 primer followed by the Urethane 645 top coat. The Epoxy 325 and Urethane 645 combination offers incredible protection from abrasions, spills, and other high-traffic risks that a warehouse faces on a daily basis. The Epoxy 325 can be used as a stand alone product if a semi gloss finish is desired and the product is available clear or colored. It is best to use the Urethane 645 as a topcoat for additional abrasion and chemical resistance. The Urethane 645 top coat leaves a high gloss finish and can be used in conjunction with a slip-resistant additive for a non-skid surface.

Garage Concrete Sealers


						
							
							
								
								One of the most common applications of a concrete sealer is a garage. Mostly all residential homes and shop floor garages are constructed out of concrete. Reasons you may want to seriously consider sealing your garage floor is to protect it from oil, fluids or just to give it a decorative finish. Depending on what you are looking to achieve, there are a few options when it comes to sealing a garage.It is recommended to use either a penetrating sealer or an epoxy system on a garage floor. A penetrating sealer like the Siloxa-Tek 8505 or the Siloxa-Tek 8510 is best if you are looking for natural finish. The major difference between the two products is that the Siloxa-tek 8505 is water based and the Siloxa-Tek 8510 is solvent based. The Siloxa-Tek products will resist degradating deicing salt damages to reduce cracking and spalling and they will resist exposure to grease and oils.If you are looking for more of a coating or decorative finish a better choice would be an epoxy system. A thin build epoxy system consists of an epoxy primer like Epoxy 325 and a urethane top coat like Urethane 645. However, if you want to get really into it and make concrete sealing fun, you can add decorative paint chips or metallic sand for a high build decorative garage floor. Penetrating sealers and epoxy systems are popular concrete sealers for a garage.

Concrete Sealer Surface Preparation


						
							
							
								
								Before applying a concrete sealer it is imperative that the surface is properly prepped to receive the concrete sealer. Improper surface preparation can result in delamination, peeling, flaking and failed application. The industry term when referring to a clean concrete substrate that is ready to accept a sealer is the concrete surface profile or CSP.When application instructions require a clean surface profile it refers to a concrete substrate free of dirt, dust, debris and other contaminates that can affect the adhesion and penetration of a sealer. Taking time to properly clean the concrete can make all the difference in regards to adhesion and penetration. Depending on how contaminated the surface is will depend on the amount of preparation. In some cases sweeping up the loose dirt and debris is sufficient. In other cases it is necessary to pressure wash or chemically etch (followed by neutralization) the surface in order to achieve a suitable surface profile. Any efflorescence, previous sealers and dyes should also be removed in most cases before resealing. Broom finished concrete is usually porous enough to accept a penetrating sealer while machine trowel substrates require additional etching to accept the sealer.In order to properly prepare concrete to accept an epoxy or urethane mechanical scarification is usually required to result in a CSP level 2 or level 3. If concrete is not porous enough to accept a sealer, the sealer is unable to bond and adhere and thus results in decreased durability. As with all sealers, always read instructions and technical data sheets on surface preparation and proper application techniques.

Decorative Concrete Sealer Fixes


						
							
							
								
								Problem: Concrete Sealer BlushingFix: Concrete Sealer Blushing also known as whitening is a common problems when applying a decorative solvent based acrylic sealer. Blushing usually occurs when a sealer is applied to a concrete surface that is wet or newly poured. The sealer is unable to adhere to the concrete surface and instead will bond with the layer of water. Blushing also occurs when the sealer is applied too heavily or thick or when there is a lot of previous sealer buildup. This build up of sealer will trap moisture under each layer and over time all of the sealer layers will delaminate from the concrete. In order to avoid this make sure the concrete substrate is complete dry before application and apply the sealer in thin, even coats instead of one heavy coat.Problem: Concrete Sealer StainingFix: Since acrylic sealers do not provide exceptional stain and chemical resistance it is common for leaves and oils to stain the sealer after application. Try a different type of sealer such as a silane/siloxane to combat staining.Problem: Water Based Sealer Turns WhiteFix: When applying a water based sealer it is important to note that it dries differently than a solvent based sealer. During application if there is too much or too little humidity this can affect the appearance of the sealer. If the polymers of the sealer evaporate before the water, the sealed surface will turn a powdery white since the particles did not have ample time to come together before drying. In order to prevent this from happening try to seal with relative humidity below 85% a have a substrate that is 5 degrees above the dew point.Problem: Solvent Based Sealer Turn WhiteFix: When a solvent based sealer turns white it is known as blushing. There are two primary causes of blushing. The first of which occurs when applying a solvent based sealer to a substrate that is wet or green and can result in the sealers inability to bond to the concrete. Instead the sealer will be stuck on a film of water. The second which occurs when a solvent based sealer is over applied or when consecutive layers of sealer are frequently applied and never removed. The thick coats of sealer can cause moisture to be trapped under the sealer leading to delamination. In order to prevent this from happening apply sealer in thin, even coats instead of one heavy application.Problem: BubblesFix: When bubbles occur after sealing this is usually a result of over application. It is best to apply in two thin coats even if only one coat is required; two thin coats are much better than one, thick, heavy coat. The first coat acts like a primer and will not look very desirable after sealing. The second coat will add the even, glossy, color enhancing finish.

Concrete Sealer Quick Fixes


						
							
								How to fix scratching, scuffing, bubbling, blotchiness, roller marks, water spots, peeling, flaking and more after a solvent based acrylic sealer was used.

							
								
								These concrete sealer quick fixes apply to solvent-based decroative acrylic sealers. Scratching/Scuffing: Scratching and scuffing are common problems. In order to prevent scratching on an interior application, use a floor wax for an additional wear layer of protection. In order to fix existing scratching, wipe Xylene on the area and reapply an extremely light new coat of concrete sealer on the area.Blotchy and Dark Concrete: Blotchy concrete can result from over application. In order to prevent over application, apply sealers in thin, even coats. If over application does occur, use Xylene to correct the problem.Water Spots: If water dries on a concrete surface that has been sealed with a concrete sealer it will dry with water droplet marks from the minerals in the water. In order to prevent this from happening avoid sealing in an area where water sprinklers constantly spray. If water spots do occur, squeegee the water dry where hard water dwells on the concrete.Roller Marks/Streaks: Roller marks or streak marks occur when the sealer was applied too heavily, unevenly, without maintaining a wet edge. Apply thin, even coats and if roller marks occur use Xylene to correct the problem.Dried Milky White: Concrete sealers dry milky white if they were applied in a low temperature or when there is an extreme amount of humidity. In order to prevent this from happening make sure to apply sealer in the early morning or late evening when the temperatures are cooler.Peeling/Flaking: Concrete sealers peel and flake when first applied if the application was too heavily applied or there are too many layers of sealer on top of each other. Delamination can commonly occur near the end of the lifespan of a sealer especially in high traffic areas or areas of direct sunlight. In order to prevent peeling and flaking of a new sealer make sure to wait until the previous sealer has worn away before applying a new layer of concrete sealer. If peeling or flaking is occurring prematurely use Xylene to correct the problem and re-solidify the concrete sealer.Bubbling: Concrete sealers bubble when the application was too heavily applied or when a sealer has been applied in direct sunlight. In order to prevent this from happening apply two thin coats of sealer instead of one heavy coat. Also make sure to apply sealer in the early morning or late evening when the temperatures are cooler. If bubbling does occur use Xylene to correct the problem and get rid of the bubbling. Do not apply another coat of sealer thinking this would rectify the issue; it will result in solvent entrapment.Apply concrete sealers in the early morning or late evening when the temperatures are cooler to avoid curing issues. 
								Why Ghostshield?
								Use the CRYLI-TEK 5505 in order to prevent future concrete sealer application issues. The Cryli-Tek 5505 is the industry's highest performing decorative sealer. This unique solvent-based formula leaves the surface with a high-gloss, wet-look shine with a clear, non-yellowing finish. This product has an extremely fast set time and an unsurpassed stain resistance. The treated surfaces will resist chipping, flaking, delamination and breakdown with UV light exposure. A matting agent is available for use with the Cryli-Tek 5505 to bring the gloss finish down to a satin or low sheen finish.

How to Repair Concrete Sealer Blushing


						
							
							
								
								Acrylic sealers are known for their beautiful decorative finishes but also their short life span and numerous problems such as blushing and bubbling. What is the cause of concrete sealer bubbling and blushing and how do you prevent it from happening?One reason acrylic concrete sealers bubble is the extremely porous nature of concrete. If an acrylic sealer is applied to an exterior application when temperatures are rising it is common for the expanding air to bubble in the sealer. Another common cause of concrete sealers bubbling is over application. When applying a solvent based acrylic sealer, the solvents in the sealer are supposed to distribute the acrylic evenly across a concrete surface, and then evaporate into the atmosphere leaving behind an acrylic film to protect the concrete. If the application of sealer is applied too heavily the solvents can become trapped under the acrylic film. They are unable to evaporate, resulting in solvent entrapment and bubbling. This is most common in high temperatures or when the sealer is applied within direct sunlight. It is best to apply a sealer is the morning or evening between 60-90 degrees F.Another common problem of acrylic sealers is a milky or white appearance which is known as blushing. This is also caused by over application and the inability for the sealer to properly evaporate.How to fix concrete blushing and bubbling?By using a nap roller, a bristle broom and Xylene applied at a rate of 250 sq. ft. per gallon, roll the Xylene into the concrete and allow it to soak until the acrylic sealer is dissolved. After a minute or two the sealer will have melted and it will become soft. Use a roller to even out any surface bubbles and blushing. If the sealer was extremely over applied, use a bristle broom to carefully scrub at the acrylic; use a roller to roll out any broom mark patterns. Do not back roll when using the roller with Xylene.

How to Remove a Concrete Sealer


						
							
								Removing a concrete sealer, whether the sealer is old, worn, faded or you just dont like how it looks, is one of the most tedious tasks! We walk you through the process step by step and make it as easy and pain free as possible.
							
								
								In order to accurately remove a concrete sealer you first need to determine the type of sealer that was initially applied. If you already know you can skip this step. How to determine if concrete was sealed with a water-based concrete sealer or a solvent-based concrete sealer:Pour a small amount of Xylene on an area that is still coated by the previous concrete sealer.Allow the Xylene to sit for 20 seconds. Remove any excess. Touch the area and if it is tacky or sticky the surface was sealed with a solvent-based sealer. If the concrete is not tacky or sticky the concrete was sealed with a water based sealer.How to remove a solvent-based concrete sealer: Start by removing any visible peeling and flaking and use a solvent based stripper such as Xylene to remove the previous sealer. (If concrete was dyed or stained, using Xylene can damage or change the color of the concrete.)Pressure wash the surface and allow concrete to completely dry.Instead of removing a previous solvent-based acrylic sealer try resealing it! You can apply a solvent-based acrylic sealer directly to the concrete without needing to remove the old sealer. First try and remove any visible peeling and flaking and then reseal according to the instructions.How to remove a water-based concrete sealer:Use a product such as Aqua Mix's Sealer and Coating Remover.You can also try acid etching the concrete (followed by neutralizing)You can mechanically scarify the concrete to remove the previous sealer.Instead of removing a water-based concrete sealer by chemically stripping or etching try pressure washing it! This method works best if the previous concrete sealer is old, faded and almost worn away.Generally speaking, in most cases, a new solvent-based concrete sealer can be applied to a surface previously sealed with a solvent-based concrete sealer; however, it cannot be applied over a surface previously sealed with a water-based concrete sealer. If you previously applied a water-based concrete sealer and are now looking to seal with a solvent-based concrete sealer you need to remove the water-based concrete sealer since the solvents will eat or soften the existing water-based concrete sealer, destroying both coatings. Water-based concrete sealers can be removed through chemical etching, aggressive pressure washing or mechanical scarification.If you previously applied a solvent-based acrylic concrete sealer and are now looking to seal with a water-based acrylic sealer you need to remove the solvent-based acrylic sealer concrete since the water-based concrete sealer will be unable to properly adhere to the solvent-based concrete sealer. Start by removing any visible peeling and flaking and use a solvent-based stripper such as Xylene to remove the previous sealer.
								Why Ghostshield?
								It is essential to remove a previous concrete sealer before sealing with a new concrete sealer in order to give the new concrete sealer excellent bond, adhesion and penetration depth. If you are looking for a long lasting high gloss, wet look sealer use the CRYLI-TEK 5505. It is a methacrylate acrylic that will not delaminate or yellow due to wear and UV light exposure. If you prefer a natural finish sealer that will not change the look or appearance of the concrete use the SILOXA-TEK 8500 which will last up to ten years before needing to be reapplied.

Choosing a Concrete Sealer for Driveways


						
							
							
								
								When it comes to sealing a driveway there are a few sealers to choose from depending on the desired finish. If you are looking to protect your driveway from common aliments such as mold, mildew, efflorescence and moisture the best product for the application would be the Lithi-Tek LS 9500. This penetrating, invisible sealer is covered under a 100 year warranty guaranteeing protection from delamination. Covering up to 1000 square feet, one gallon of the concentrated Lithi-Tek 9500 will waterproof, densify the concrete and is nontoxic applied by a pump sprayer.The Lithi-Tek 9500 can be used in a warmer climate where there is no risk of snow, salt, mad chlorides and frigid temperatures. If you live in a climate plagued with winters or if you are looking for a Department of Transportation approved sealer the best sealer to use would be the Siloxa-Tek 8500. In order to protect your concrete driveway and walkways from salt degradation, spalling, pitting and freeze-thaw cycles this high percentage solids silane/siloxane blend is really the only option to ensure your driveway remains intact all winter long. Siloxa-Tek 8500 is also an invisible, penetrating sealer that is completely breathable leaving the concrete with a natural finish.The Siloxa-Tek 8505 or the Siloxa-Tek 8510 are great options is if you are looking for deicing salt protection, freeze-thaw protection and resistance to oils and staining. The Siloxa-Tek 8505 is water based and the Siloxa-Tek 8510 is solvent based. If you are looking to seal a stamped concrete driveway, decorative paver driveway, dyed, stained or stenciled driveway your best bet would be to go with a high performance acrylic sealer. When it comes to choosing an acrylic sealer your best bet is to go with a high solids sealer that will not delaminate and will resist harsh UV light. If you are looking for a gloss, wet look finish Cryli-Tek 5505 is the best option. This solvent based acrylic will outperform and outlast without the risk of peeling and flaking.

Brick House Sealer


						
							
							
								
								Many people often do not realize that bricks are actually a form of concrete. However, unlike those tough, gray surfaces that usually come to mind when we think of concrete, brick is a more porous, more delicate material. However, if your home is made of brick, the level of protection you are getting is certainly fine. To increase this protection, though, you need to treat your brick exteriors and facades with a high quality concrete sealer specially designed for use on brick.Brick is especially delicate, and the only real option for sealing a brick exterior (or even a brick chimney, if that is the only brick surface your home features) is a silane/siloxane type of sealer. The Siloxa-Tek 8510 is the only real choice for anyone wanting comprehensive protection that is long-lasting. While other products may give the same level of protection, they will not last as long. The Siloxa-Tek 8510 is a penetrating silane/siloxane solution, specifically designed for use on brick and masonry substrates. The way the sealer is designed, it is better suited to being applied on vertical surfaces. The sealer is a clear, solvent based product that provides a translucent exterior that will not mar the visual appeal of your brick exterior. The sealer will create a hydrophobic barrier, locking out water and salts, as well as any other external threats, ensuring that your brick does not crack, crumble, and corrode over time, as unprotected brick is widely known to do.

Concrete Sealer for a Highway


						
							
							
								
								In order for highways to remain as strong and reliable as possible, they need to be taken care of. By using a quality concrete sealing product you are able to protect them from the elements, especially constant exposure to the sun, rain, snow, and harmful deicing salts and chlorides. Concrete sealers come in a wide variety of kinds, each suited to a specific and particular type of project. For a concrete highway, the best choice would be a silane/siloxane concrete sealer. Silane/siloxane concrete sealers, like the Department of Transportation Approved Siloxa-Tek 8500, contain particles of silane and particles of siloxane. The silane particles will penetrate slightly past the surface of the concrete while the siloxane particles will pool on the surface of the concrete to be spread out over the course of the application process. Together, the two types of particles suspeneded in the Siloxa-Tek's water-based solution will work in concrete to create a hydrophobic barrier that locks out excessive water, as well as other minerals (like salts from DOT trucks in the winter), from entering the concrete where they can wreak havoc, resulting in potentially costly repairs.

Concrete Sealer for Bridges


						
							
							
								
								Bridges are crucial to the continued day-to-day functioning of the United States. Bridges are incredibly important to the infrastructure of the United States, and they are slowly crumbling due to the ravages of time, the elements, and wear from millions of tires and cars. These structures tend to be built from concrete, one of the strongest manmade materials on Earth. However, concrete is by no means destined to live an infinitely strong life without any degradation. To the contrary, concrete is incredibly strong, but it is also susceptible to overwhelming damage.Concrete is created by mixing together water, Portland cement, and some sort of aggregate, such as gravel or sand. Directly linked to this process are the numerous microscopic pores and hairline cracks that extend like a network throughout each and every concrete slab. These pores and cracks leave concrete susceptible to water damage and other potential harm from salts and other minerals. Over time, these threats can degrade the structural integrity of the concrete, which can be utterly disastrous and tragic if it happens to bridges.In order to prevent collapses and increase the longevity of our bridges concrete, the bridges need to be sealed as soon as possible after their pouring with a high quality concrete sealer. A concrete sealer like the Department of Transportation Approved Siloxa-Tek 8500 will offer a comprehensive level of protection for concrete bridges, with the small, penetrating particles of silane working in concert with the larger, surface particles of siloxane to create a hydrophobic barrier that locks out water and harmful salts. With just this simple application, the lives of bridges can be improved a hundredfold, ensuring the longest lasting and strongest concrete humanly possible.

Best Silane Siloxane Sealer


						
							
							
								
								With numerous choices facing anyone who wishes to purchase a concrete sealer, it is imperative that you narrow down your choices by general type of sealer. For many applications, silane/siloxane sealers are flexible options that provide excellent coverage and protection of numerous types of concrete surfaces and concrete sealing situations.Silane/siloxane sealers are sealers that contain particles of silane and siloxane. Silane particles are small, designed to penetrate past the surface of the concrete substrate. It is important to note, however, that silane/siloxane sealers are not concrete densifiers, and they will not react chemically with the material. Rather, the penetrating silane particles will work in concrete with the surface level siloxane particles to create a hydrophobic barrier that will comprehensively block out water and salts from passing through the concrete.Siloxa-Tek 8500 is the perfect silane/siloxane sealer on the market today. It is a Department of Transportation approved, water-based solution that is easy to use and safe to apply with fewer fumes and less flammability. Siloxa-Tek 8500 has proven to work in consistent testing and trials, and is being considered to be the exclusive silane/siloxane sealer option for Departments of Transporation across the country. Its updated formula and make-up have vaulted the Siloxa-Tek 8500 to stand alone among other silane/siloxanes, and is unquestionably the perfect choice for your concrete project requiring a silane/siloxane sealer. This product will not only repel water and moisture intrusion but it will repel deicing salts to prevent any cracking, spalling, pitting or degradation.If you are looking for a silane/siloxane sealer that is resistant to water, deicing salts AND staining from oils, leaves and grese the best products to use are the water based Sioxa-Tek 8505 OR the solvent based Siloxa-Tek 8510.

Kennel Concrete Sealer


						
							
							
								
								If you've ever been in a kennel, or even used one to house your animals, you know the unpleasant smell that can plague some of establishments that arent as clean. Sometimes, it is not even a black mark on the kennels cleanliness, but an indictment of their concrete. Most kennels are made from poured concrete that serves as the floor for the dog-residents to rest on. However, many kennels do not seal their concrete, leading to a painstaking and tiresome cleaning process every time an animal has an accident.Even after the accident has been cleaned, the smell can linger. This is because the offending particles, either urine or solid waste, seeps into the pores of the concrete, becoming part of the floor itself. Once this has happened, it is extremely difficult and often impossible to remove.Luckily, the prevention is easy. You simply need to treat the concrete in your kennel with a quality concrete sealer. If you have an old concrete floor, you'll need to clean the surface first. However, if your floor is new and has cured for at least twenty-eight days, then you can apply the sealer right away to ensure comprehensive protection.The best option to seal a kennel floor is an epoxy/urethane combination. Epoxy 325 and Urethane 645 are industrial grade aliphatic and cyclo-aliphatic coatings, respectively. With their chemical resistant, acid resistant and abrasion resistant properties you can ensure that the kennel floor will be protected from uric acid, scratches and any sort of cleaning chemicals. By using the Epoxy 325 as a primer and the Urethane 645 as a topcoat, this is by far the most effect and bullet proof option for a kennel floor. All of these benefits lead to the biggest one of them all: the floors will be easy to clean. No longer will you have to worry about stains and unpleasant smells, aside from that wet-dog smell we all love.  The epoxy/urethane combination will lock out those particles, allowing you to wipe up the messes on the surface level without any intensive scrubbing.

Best Sealer for Colored Concrete


						
							
							
								
								While concretes natural gray exterior can leave something to be desired for the eye wanting a wider aesthetic appeal, its structural benefits and natural strength and longevity cannot be ignored or overlooked. However, new breakthroughs in technology and engineering have led to a number of different options for coloring your concrete.Foremost among these options are concrete dyes. While acid stains have traditionally been the most popular choice, they offer only limited strains of color choices, mostly being neutral colors. Concrete dyes, on the other hand, come in blues, yellows, and reds. The can also be mixed together to create an incredibly wide variety of colors from all over the color wheel.The flexibility of concrete dyes have made them a choice that continues to grow in popularity. They are a penetrating type of sealer whose particles of coloring will penetrate past the surface of the concrete. As such, they are long-lasting and strong, able to withstand a number of elemental and environmental damages. They are also extremely easy to apply and clean up, as the solution penetrates past the surface, leaving very little to be sopped up afterwards.In order to protect a concrete dye or acid stain use an acrylic based sealer. If you are looking for a low sheen, satin finish the best product to use would be the water-based Cryli-Tek 5500. If you are looking for more of a gloss, wet-look finish the solvent based Cryli-Tek 5505 is the best option. With the application of Cryli-Tek 5500 or Cryli-Tek 5505, the colored concrete will retain its level of color for years to come.

Parking Garage Concrete Sealer


						
							
							
								
								Parking garages are one of the best business investments, especially in a city near a sports complex or a concert hall. As parking in cities can be nearly impossible to find, parking garages make a significant source of profit and revenue for anyone. Parking garages are typically structures made entirely of concrete, making them fairly cheap to construct with relatively little maintenance.However, if you want there to be little maintenance, you have to take a couple of precautionary steps before sitting back in complacency. Concrete, while incredibly strong and long-lasting, is not guaranteed to remain unharmed over the years. In fact, it can be at a high risk of cracking, crumbling, and various other forms of degradation over the years. The easiest way to prevent this potential damage is to treat the concrete structure, in its entirety, with a high quality concrete sealer.The best choice in concrete sealer for a project like this would be a silane/siloxane sealer, like the Siloxa-Tek 8510. The Siloxa-Tek 8510 is a sealer featuring a mixture of silane and siloxane particles. The two types of particles are suspended in a solvent-based solution that transports the particles to the surface of the concrete. Once at the surface, the silane particles will penetrate slightly past the surface of the concrete, while the larger siloxane particles will remain on the surface of the concrete in a pool to be spread out. Once the solution has been spread out, the particles will bond to the surface, leading to the creation of a hydrophobic barrier that will repel water.The repelling of water is one of the most important functions of a concrete sealer, as the incursion of water into concrete can lead to a large amount of future problems. If your parking garage is located in an area with a colder climate, then your structure can be at risk of freeze/thaw cycles. These cycles are one of the most devastating threats to concrete, water can seep into the concrete in the warmer months to freeze during the winter before thawing in the spring. The water expands and retracts, leading to cracks that cannot be easily fixed and can lead to further future crumbling. The other major benefit of using the Siloxa-Tek 8510 product is that it is resistant to staining from oils and grease. If you own a parking garage constructed of concrete, then you should treat it with Siloxa-Tek 8510 to ensure it lasts as long as it can.

Driveway Paver Sealer


						
							
							
								
								Pavers are, in fact, a type of concrete that is used primarily in warmer climates, such as in California or Florida. This type of concrete is somewhat more delicate and prone to extreme damage in colder climates that suffer through harsh winters, making it a popular choice for warmer areas. Pavers are found to comprise driveways, patios, and pool decks in a wide variety of homes. They are inexpensive, aesthetically appealing, and fairly easy to maintain, all of which makes them a decidedly attractive option for installation.However, as pavers are typically made up of concrete, they can fall prey to a wide variety of potential problems that can harm their structural integrity and visual aesthetic charm. For instance, if you have pavers in your driveway, patio, or pool deck, excessive exposure to moisture and water can lead to degradation, corrosion, and cracking, all of which will likely result in costly repairs.When treating pavers you can choose to apply a natural finish product that is going to give you the longest lasting protection, or a decorative finish product that will enhance the look, finish and textures of the pavers. If you are looking for a natural finish product the best sealers to use are the Siloxa-Tek 8500 or the Siloxa-Tek 8505 (if you are looking for additional protection from staining from grease, leaves or oils). Natural finish, penetrating sealers are going to give the longest lasting protection and can last upwards of ten years before another application is required. (In comparison, acylic sealers do need to be reapplied more frequently than penetrating sealers, about every one to three years). The Siloxa-Tek products are also deicing salt and freeze-thaw cycle resistant so they will protect a pave driveway against spalling, pitting, cracking and degradation.If you are looking for a decorative finish the best sealer to use would be an acrylic which is made up of large particles of sealant and function like raincoats, keeping the water on the surface of the concrete rather than allowing it to penetrate past the surface. They also have the great added benefit of resisting UV rays and the discoloration they wreak on your concrete, making youre your pavers remain bright and fresh. Cryli-Tek 5500 or Cryli-Tek 5505, will provide more than enough protection for your structure made out of pavers. The two sealers mentioned above are acrylic sealers, respectively of the water- and solvent-based kind. Cryli-Tek 5505 gives pavers a high gloss, wet look finish enhancing the color and texture. Cryli-Tek 5500 gives pavers a satin, low sheen finish slightly enhancing the colors and textures.

Sealer for Garage Floor


						
							
							
								
								Your garage floor is likely made of concrete, which has the distinction of being incredibly durable. However, it is also a material made up of crushed stone, cement, water, and air, all of which have bound to form concrete. The negative to this mixture is the large number of tiny air bubbles that naturally occur in concrete; these air bubbles are what let oil and other vehicle leakages seep into the material, as well being what makes it so difficult to fully remove stains.In order to effectively protect your garage floor from stains, oil or otherwise, you need to seal your floor with a good concrete sealer. Concrete sealers help protect your concrete from natural elements, such as water damage, as well as from inadvertent error, like the spilling of oil. However, as there are a number of different chemical formulas for concrete sealers, you want to find the product that best suits your needs: protection from oil stains.Siloxa-Tek 8505 is a water based penetrating sealer formulated using molecular nano technology and is an excellent solution for a concrete garage floor. For oil stains, the key is to seal off the surface of the concrete, which this silane-siloxane blended sealer will do. Since the 8505 is formulated with a fluropolymer it is able to resist staining from oils and greases forming an olephobic barrier at the surface preventing the passage of fluids. The surface protection will leave the oil pooled on top of the concrete for an easy clean up, rather than leaking into the pores of the concrete to leave a nasty stain. If you are sealing a larger garage floor, or are looking for a higher performing version, the Siloxa-Tek 8510 is the solvent based counterpart to the Siloxa-Tek 8505.The other choice is the Epoxy 325 primer coupled with the Urethane 645 topcoat. These two sealers work in conjunction to provide comprehensive protection for your garage floor from abrasions, chemicals, oil stains, and more. The Epoxy 325 bonds directly to the concrete substrate, and the Urethane 645 is a clear topcoat that will bind to the Epoxy 325, further increasing the protection.

Concrete Driveway Sealer


						
							
							
								
								Using a concrete sealer to protect your concrete driveway is the best choice you can make to care for your driveway. These concrete sealing products have the main job of protecting the concrete, enhancing the longevity of the material; however, they also restore your concrete, improving its resistance to UV rays of the sun, water damage, salts, and other environmental hazards that can mar the visual and structural integrity of your concrete driveway. If you opt not to treat your driveway, you may fall prey to cracking, crumbling, spalling, and other sorts of degradations that could be costly to repair.If you live in an area where deicing salts were used on the roadways the best choice to seal your concrete from all sorts of damage is Siloxa-Tek 8500. This silane/siloxane based sealer is formulated with two component solutions that contain an optimized ratio of silane and siloxane particles. Silane is a mild penetrating particle that will penetrate past the surface of the concrete to lock out water. The siloxane particles will then spread out over the surface to lock out threats. These two types of particles work in concerte to create a solid hydrophobic barrier to help increase your concrete driveways resistance to the elements. Not only is Siloxa-Tex 8500 the highest quality driveway sealer but it is also Department of Transportation approved. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 will protect the driveway from deicing salts, freeze-thaw cycles, spalling, pitting and cracking.If you are looking for additional protection from oils and staining from leaves the best products to use are the Siloxa-Tek 8505 water-based or the Siloxa-Tek 8510 solvent-based. These two products will give you all the protection and benefits of the Siloxa-Tek 8500 with added stain resistance. If you are looking for an econmical product for a driveway that will not be exposed to deicing salts the Lithi-Tek 9500 is a great option. The Lithi-Tek 9500 will give your driveway excellent water repellency and protection from orgnaic growth. The Lithi-Tek 9500 is available in an ultra concentrated formula with one gallon mixing with four gallons of water to make a five gallon bucket of sealer.

Best Roof Tile Sealer


						
							
							
								
								Regardless of whether your roof is made up of tiles of shingles, as long as these materials are comprised of concrete, there are some steps you need to take to ensure an appropriate level of protection.A roof made of tiles features a high risk of leakage, moisture can easily seep into the concrete material, which can, in turn, leak into your home. Contrary to appearances, concrete is a naturally porous material. Its mixture of water, Portland cement, and aggregate (such as stone, gravel, or sand) leads to tiny pores and hairline cracks that extend throughout the concrete.These air pockets are often too miniscule to see with the human eye, though the surface pores that begin the networks of cracks and pores are often clearly visible. Whether from snow, rain, or melting ice, water can seep into the concrete through the surface to make its way through the network of cracks and pores until it leaks out the other side. The concrete becomes saturated with water, and the liquid has nowhere to go but downward into your home.Fortunately, it is easy to protect your concrete roof tiles thereby protecting your home from water damage. The best, most cost-effective method is to apply a concrete sealer to your roof in order to prevent water leakage. Siloxa-Tek 8500 or Siloxa-Tek 8510 are the best options to protect your roof, especially in salt water environments. They are penetrating sealers that will impregnate the concrete roof tiles, and protect them from degradation, carbonization, salts and corrosion. Penetrating concrete sealers like these are an inexpensive and straightforward way to prevent future damage to your home, all while helping to prevent mold, mildew, efflorescence, and other problems that can threaten a houses integrity.

Epoxy Concrete Sealer


						
							
							
								
								If you have a project that involves a concrete surface and needs a concrete sealer, there are a number of different options available to you. Epoxies are the sealer of choice for a number of high traffic projects that need to protect concrete surfaces from scratches, abrasions, chemical spills, heat, and many other such dangers that plague environments like industrial warehouses, large retail stores, and even airports.If you are looking for an epoxy sealer, you should choose the Epoxy 325. The Epoxy 325 is a high quality sealer that seals your concrete to leave a translucent layer that will protect the concrete from chemical spills, acid spills, excessive exposure to heat, scratches, abrasions, and many other potential threats to the concrete slabs structural integrity and visual appeal. The Epoxy 325 actually works best as part of an epoxy floor system. Epoxy floor systems are systems that mix the preventative and protective aspects of a few different types of sealers. The Epoxy 325 particularly works best when paired with the Urethane 645 or the Polyaspartic 745, depending on what your particular project entails.The Epoxy 325 on its own offers substantive protection, but that protection can be increased dramatically when paired with a urethane topcoat. The Polyaspartic 745 and the Urethane 645 are both types of urethanes  the only difference is that the Polyaspartic 745 dries significantly faster than the Urethane 645, which can be a necessity for such projects as sealing the floor of a large retail store that needs to be open the next morning. Whatever your project requires, use the Epoxy 325 as a basecoat, followed by the Urethane 645 or Polyaspartic 745 for a clear, strong topcoat to help ensure your concrete reaches its full potential.

Concrete Block Basement Sealer


						
							
							
								
								Water damage is one of the worst nightmares a home or building owner can have. Imagine walking downstairs into your basement after a week of rain, only to find that there is standing water of four inches and counting. As you hear the splash of water rushing through the concrete block walls in the basement concrete that you previously did not think problematic, you simply are overwhelmed by the damage to your property and possessions.The easiest way to deal with this problem is, of course, to prevent it. By using a concrete sealer proactively, you can prevent the blocks from seeping water which can lead to extreme damage. While it is better to apply the concrete sealer as soon as possible, you can also apply it later, though you have to be sure that you properly clean the slab and remove all paint before beginning the application process.If your basement is made up of concrete blocks, it would be best to use Siloxa-Tek 8500. Siloxa-Tek 8500 is a silane/siloxane solution that will penetrate within the concrete while simultaneously protecting the surface of the concrete with an invisible hydrophobic barrier. This dual protection will help prevent water from penetrating, all while locking out moisture and vapor from the pores and hairline cracks present within the concrete.Siloxa-Tek 8500 is an industrial grade water-based solution offering comprehensive protection with two coats, drying within a day and providing up to 250 square feet of sealer for every gallon. This multifunctional sealer not only protects concrete blocks but also a wide variety of mineral substrates including architectural concrete, concrete block, splitface block, pavers, stucco, porous and dense brick, clay tile, exposed aggregate concrete, sandstone, and slate. This unique formula incorporates leading molecular nanotechnology; putting a permanent end to water and moisture migration through even the most porous concrete blocks.

Best Wet Look Sealer


						
							
							
								
								One of the most desired concrete finishes is a wet look. A wet look sealer is an excellent choice for decorative concrete, stamped concrete and colored concrete since it enhances and beautifies. So how do you achieve this much desired wet look? Cryli-Tek 5505is the most advanced, industrial strength decorative solution. This solvent based acrylic is a high performance sealer that incorporates our leading molecular nanotechnology. Easily applied with a 3/8" nap roller, the clear, high gloss, non yellowing finish surpasses anything else on the market.What sets Cryli-Tek 5505 apart from other wet look acrylics is the formulation using nanotechnology. Since nanotechnology involves the direct manipulation of atoms, we are able to construct the sealer from the bottom up using techniques to develop the highest performing seal. Since our team starts by deconstructing the atomic components on the nanoscale vs. the macroscale, changed properties result from the changed size and structure.Through this manipulation of our nanoparticles and the way they are then structurally assembled, Cryli-Tek 5505 has an extremely fast set time and an unsurpassed stain resistance. The sealer will never chip, flake, breakdown or delaminate with UV exposure. Cryli-Tek 5505 is specially formulated to seal decorative and residential concrete while enhancing the color of stamped concrete, exposed aggregate, and colored concrete pavers; giving these surfaces the deepest, richest appearance possible. Cryli-Tek 5505 gives concrete a high gloss finish that highlights the color and texture of surfaces. If you are looking for the highest quality wet look sealer available on the market you can look no further than Cryli-Tek 5505.

Concrete Sealer for Freeze Thaw Damage


						
							
							
								
								Freeze/thaw damage is a problem that plagues contractors, professional builders, road maintenance workers, and homeowners alike. The weather cannot be avoided or outsmarted, especially in places that suffer from harsh winters where freeze/thaw damage is almost inevitable.Freeze/thaw cycles damage your concrete through a process that begins in the summer and fall, the warmer months. If there is a substantial amount of water within the concrete with the onset of winter, the freeze/thaw cycle has its first parameter that it needs to begin. When concrete has been saturated with water, either due to a poor mixing process or due to a lack of concrete sealer, the concrete will freeze in the winter. The water inside the concrete causes the material to freeze, which then leads to the concretes expansion as the water needs more room to freeze and become rigid. Now, the concretes structural integrity has been compromised  with the melting of ice, the concrete will crack and bow under pressure. These cracks are disastrous to your concrete and completely unavoidable once the water has frozen.A significant amount of tiny pores and hairline cracks make up any slab of concrete as they are a natural by-product of the mixing process. These pores and cracks extend throughout the concrete like a web, offering safe passage and storage for large quantities of water that manage to make their way past the surface pores of the concrete. While moisture passage through the concrete is expected and not harmful, it becomes problematic when the water does not pass through, instead sitting within the material. At this point, it is too late to avoid freeze/thaw damage, as there is really no way to draw water from concrete.The only way to prevent freeze/thaw damage is to treat your concrete with a quality concrete sealer. By usingSiloxa-Tek 8500a blend of both a silane and a siloxane. These two sealers will work in concert to create a hydrophobic barrier to lock out excessive water and moisture from seeping into the concrete. Not only that but salt degradation, mold, mildew, efflorescence, staining and cracking will all be prevented. Without water within the concrete, the freeze/thaw cycle poses no threat, and your concrete will remain protection regardless of the season.

Basement Waterproofing


						
							
							
								
								Nothing is worse than walking down into a basement to find the walls or the carpets wet. Basements are prone to flooding since they are the lowest level of a building built in close proximity to the water table. The most vulnerable basements are located fully below ground with no way for water to drain away from the house. Moving water seeks the path of least resistance and finds its way through small cracks, and voids in the concrete or cinderblock foundation.A lot of times basements will not completely flood but they will have seepage. Seepage occurs when water creeps in through the pores and capillary tracts of the concrete thus soaking into the finished walls and carpets. Seepage usually occurs through small cracks in a basement foundation or through extremely porous concrete blocks.Another common cause for basement flooding is improper sealing techniques or lack there of. If basement walls and foundations were not properly sealed during a home's construction, water will seep through during even most apparent weather conditions. If your basement fills with water after a rain storm you need to seal it to prevent future impending water damage. More importantly if your basement has never been sealed you need to take the proper precautions and seal it before it is too late.This is where Lithi-Tek 9500 comes into play. The Lithi-Tek 9500 product is a penetrating waterproofing and densifying concrete sealer all-in-one formulated utilizing nano-technology.Benefits of the molecularly engineered Lithi-Tek 9500:Stronger, smaller, lighter nanoparticles are able to effectively penetrate deeper and chemically react more evenly.More accurate penetration and ability for the formulas to travel through all voids, pores and tracts, chemically bonding to the concrete.Smallest atomic structures possible, one thousand times smaller than the wavelengths of light, resulting from the manipulation of single nanoparticle molecules in finely controlled ways.Improved systems to control penetration and prevent/resist water, mold, mildew, efflorescence, radon, hydrostatic pressure and water vapor transmission.The Lithi-Tek 9500 is a great option to prevent any future moisture or water issues on any poured concrete substrate. However, if you are looking to treat an area that has been exposured to moisture or has had active seepage, it is best to use a two step process. First use the Lithi-Tek 4500 product as a primer, wait seven days and then apply the Siloxa-Tek 8500as a top coat. Keep in mind that if you are looking to treat concrete blocks or concrete cinderblocks the best product to use is the Siloxa-Tek 8500 as a stand alone product.

Sidewalk Sealer


						
							
							
								
								Sidewalks are functional paths that allow for walks, jogs and foot traffic while also adding aesthetically pleasing appeal to the neighborhood. In order to protect the sidewalks and keep them looking up to date and clean it is necessary that you apply a concrete sealer. By applying a penetrating sealer there is no risk of peeling, flaking or delamination common to acrylic sealers. By using Lithi-Tek 9500 sidewalks are permanently protected and water, mold, mildew, efflorescence and lichen are all prevented.Lithi-Tek 9500 is an industrial grade, penetrating concrete sealer, densifier and waterproofer. Through densification, concrete's pores, voids and tracts are filled and concrete's compressive strength is increased. In conjunction, an invisible hydrophobic barrier is created on the surface to prevent the penetration of water, fluids and any other contaminants the surface may come into contact with. This unique blend is industry leading and is extremely multifunctional with a variety of applications.If you live in an area of the country that is exposed to deicing salts the best option would be the Siloxa-Tek 8500. The  Siloxa-Tek 8500 is able to resist deicing salt damage and freeze-thaw cycles. It can also be used on brick, stone, and pavers whereas the Lithi-Tek 9500 can only be used on poured concrete sidewalks. If you are looking for additional protection from staining of oils, grease and leaves the best option will be the Siloxa-Tek 8505.

Garage Floor Sealer


						
							
							
								
								Garage floors are one of the most important and understated parts of our homes. While we tend to think of the concrete of our foundations and our basements as being important, the garage floor can slip away from our notice. However, garage floors are equally valuable for the visual aesthetic appeal of your home, as well as for the structural integrity of your house. Garages are a sort of gateway into your home, and you do not want anything going wrong with the garage floor, as fixes can be costly and time consuming.The best way to prevent any problems, of course, is to apply a concrete sealer to your garage floors. As garage floors are a boundary between the outdoors and the indoors, a strong concrete sealer is needed. One route would be the use of a penetrating concrete sealer that is also a salt and stain repellent. Siloxa-Tek 8505 will penetrate past the surface of the concrete to impregnate the concrete. The Siloxa-Tek 8505 is a water based, silane/siloxane blended sealer that is able to resist spalling, cracking and degradation when exposed to deicing salts. Also because of the fluoro polymer in the formula, it also repels staining from oils and greases which is especially helpful in garage applications. If you have an industrial or commercial garage the Siloxa-Tek 8510 is the solvent based version of the Siloxa-Tek 8505 and an excellent choice. The other main concrete sealer option for a garage floor is an epoxy floor system with a urethane topcoat. Epoxy sealers like Epoxy 325 are surface level sealers that bond to the concrete substrate, exhibiting excellent protection from heat, salt, water, abrasion, scratches, and the various spills from your car or workbench. To enhance the concrete sealers performance even further, it is best to use an epoxy floor system, that features an epoxy basecoat followed by a urethane topcoat. Urethanes like Urethane 645 are clear sealers that are even stronger than epoxies, featuring all of the same benefits with added chemical resistance properties and UV protection. Either an epoxy system or a penetrating densifying waterproofing sealer would be excellent to protect your concrete garage floor from man-made errors and the elements.

Basement Waterproofing Sealer


						
							
							
								
								There are a few reasons why you want to seize the moment and seal your basement before winter. If you live in an area where it snows in the winter it is especially imperative that you continue reading this article. Spring brings melting, flooding and an all around wet season. The snow is melting and the ground is wet and basements are prone to flooding, and water damage.The first step you need to take is to assess whether or not you have had previous moisture issues in your basement. Think back to last spring, have you ever sealed your basement before and is the sealer you used working? Is it bubbling or peeling or are you still experiencing moisture issues? If so this is a sign that you a.) did not use a high quality industrial grade sealer or b.) the water is coming in through some unsound cracks in your basement.If you used a previous sealer you need to make sure you etch the floor to remove the previous sealer. Next you need to fix all basement cracks. Use a crack filler or crack sealer to make sure that there are no possible outlets for water to enter the basement. You are then going to want to seal your basement with a high quality concrete sealer. If you basement foundation was built with concrete blocks or cinderblocks you need to use a silane/siloxane blended sealer like Siloxa-Tek 8500. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 works best on concrete blocks because of the porous nature of the blocks and the larger molecular size of the silane/siloxane particles.If your basement foundation was poured and you are preventatively sealing (meaning you have never has any moisture or seepage issues) your best option would be the Lithi-Tek 9500. The Lithi-Tek 9500 is a densifier, waterproofer and sealer all in one. This product will help prevent all future moisture issues by chemically reacting with the concrete to form calcium silicate hydrate inside of the concrete and sealing the surface all-in-one.If your basement foundation was poured and you have experienced moisture or seepage issues in the past your best option would be the Lithi-Tek 4500 product followed by the Siloxa-Tek 8500 (applied 7 days after the Lithi-Tek 4500). The combination of the two products provides unsurpassed protection to keep water from seeping through the concrete causing damage.

How to Prevent Salt Degradation 


						
							
							
								
								With the ever lasting winter raging on throughout the entire country, this widespread snow will cause more damage than you might be anticipating. Wherever there is snow, there is salt. This salt is used to melt the snow and prevent roads, driveways, walkways and sidewalks from becoming excessively slippery. While the salt is melting snow it is also causing excessive damage to roads, driveways and sidewalks erroding the concrete and causing additional voids, spalling and cracking.In order to prevent the aforementioned from occurring, the use of Siloxa-Tek 8500 will help to prevent any sort of salt degradation. This high solids silane/siloxane blend will not only penetrate to protect from within, but a hydrophobic barrier is created, preventing the passage of snow, water and salt. Used by the Department of Transportation, high solids silane/siloxanes are tested by drawing core samples of areas treated with the sealer. If the sealer is able to pass a series of tests including water absorption and chloride ion ingress it is then approved by the DOT and used on various bridges and roadways in the state. An outstanding feature of the product is that the treated surfaces will show no change in visual appearance from application and the surface will not chip, flake, delaminate or breakdown with UV light exposure. Siloxa-Tek 8500 is able to repel deicing salts and chlroides and protect concrete from spalling, pitting, cracking and corrosion. Long lasting protection from salt degradation with an easy application and proven DOT results make Siloxa-Tek 8500 an industry leading solution.

Exposed Aggregate Concrete Sealer


						
							
							
								
								Exposed aggregate concrete is one of the most vulnerable types of slabs to certain elemental and human threats to its structural integrity, longevity, and visual appeal. Concrete itself is an incredibly strong material that can withstand many years of damage and wear (theoretically even tens of thousands, though that is difficult to prove) without losing any of its famed and noted strength. However, concrete itself can also deteriorate far quicker than its potential would have you believe, especially due to human wear and too much exposure to the elements.Exposed aggregate is threatened by a number of potential problems, such as excessive water damage and too much salt diffusion throughout the concrete, especially in the winter months. For instance, if water seeps into the exposed aggregate and concrete in the warmer months through the Spring, Summer, and Fall, that water will likely sit in the concrete, remaining clogged in the network of hairline cracks and microscopic pores that are natural to all concrete. While the water does not pose an especially serious threat to the concretes structural integrity in the warmer months, it can be disastrous and ruinous in the colder winter. With the onset of winter, that water sitting complacently within the concrete will slowly freeze, expanding as it does so to crack the concrete. However, these cracks will only become visible with the coming of Spring and the melting of the ice within the concrete  now, the ice shrinks and much of the water leaks out of the cracks that have been newly created, leading to numerous costly and time consuming problems.Similarly, exposed aggregate can be harmed by excess salt seeping into the concrete, especially in the winter months with the advent of salt trucks that make the roads safer. Too much salt seeping into the exposed aggregate can lead to tremendous structural problems. Fortunately, there is an easy preventative measure you can take. Simply apply a concrete sealer, like Siloxa-Tek 8500 to the exposed aggregate. The Siloxa-Tek 8500, a water-based silane/siloxane sealer, will leave a natural finish and act as a barrier, bonding to the concrete substrate in order to provide comprehensive protection from water, UV radiation, and salt damage.

Stop Water Sealer


						
							
							
								
								The most common question we are asked concerns stopping water, preventing future water damage and reducing moisture and vapor. With the proximity of a basement to the water table it is extremely common for basements to flood, or have water seeping through the walls. There is nothing worse then walking down to your finished basement just to see a wet wall or soaked carpet. The trouble of having to rip up the carpet and tear down the walls is costly and time consuming not to mention the damage to furniture and decor. So what is the best method of preventing this disastrous situation from happening to you?Lithi-Tek 9500 is a spray applied, liquid, penetrating sealer that chemically reacts with the calcium silicate hydrate in concrete and with the carbon dioxide in the air. The blend of silicates and siliconates is one of the most innovative solutions utilizing molecular nanotechnology for deeper penetration and the most even disbursement of sealer. Through densification all interior pores, voids and tracts are filled and sealed while a hydrophobic barrier at the surface prevents the penetrating of water. Available in an industry first ultra concentrate the Lithi-Tek 9500 is a very cost effective option since 1 gallon mixes with 4 gallons of water to make 5 gallons of sealer. The MSRP retail of 1 ultra concentrated gallon of Lithi-Tek 9500 is $99.88 (which breaks down to less than $20 a gallon after it is mixed with water) Other benefits of using this industry leading sealer include:Reduces water and moisture intrusionBecomes an integral part of the concrete, forming a complete body of strength and durability with 100% of the results occurring below the surface.Penetrates deeply and seals concretes capillary tracts and shrinkage cracks preventing the growth of mold and mildew and the spread of radon.Resists high hydrostatic pressure.Resists the spread of water vapor transmission.Increases concretes compressive strengthCombats Alkali Silica Reaction (ASR).Efflorescence attacks are prevented.Seals hairline and shrinkage cracks rather than merely masking or bridging them.Waterproofing and chemical-resistance properties remain intact even if the surface is damaged.Dries clear. The color and look of the concrete will not change after sealing resulting in 100% transparent and non-slip surfaces.Easy to apply, labor-cost effective.Nontoxic, Low VOCs and no harmful fumes.

How to Prevent Concrete Sweating


						
							
								Have you ever experienced the phenomena of concrete sweating? Concrete sweating is often times mistaken for a water problem since it is common to see a condensation effect on the surface of the slab. Continue reading to learn how to prevent and reduce concrete sweating. 
							
								
								What causes concrete to sweat? When warm air comes into contact with a colder temperature concrete slab, the condensation will build up on the surface and can commonly be defined as concrete sweating. The combination of temperature swings and humidity build up cause the concrete to sweat.How do you prevent concrete sweating? Dry out the room by air movement: a high volume low speed fan works well.Turn down the air conditioning/turn up the heat to keep the concrete floor temperature and the air temperature at similiar levels.Use a dehumidifier to remove moisture from the air and reduce the condensation.Use a penetrating sealer to seal the concrete and keep out moisture. We recommend using a concrete densifier first as a primer followed up  a penetrating stain repellent. Mold and mildew are a result of concrete sweating so using a penetrating concrete sealer at the first signs of concrete sweating is ideal. 
								Why Ghostshield?
								Use the LITHI-TEK 4500 first as a primer to reduce the porosity of the concrete. When concrete sweats it draws out grease and oil residue that may have previously seeped into the concrete pores. By using the SILOXA-TEK 8510 penetrating concrete sealer, oil and greases are kept out of the concrete emilinating staining. Siloxa-Tek 8510 is also a salt repellent concrete sealer so it will protect the concrete floor from any spalling, pitting and cracking. The combination of these two products will prevent concrete sweating also and reduce any mold and mildew that may accumulate.

Waterproofers for Concrete


						
							
							
								
								Think of a sponge, with all of the open pockets and pores and the porous nature that allows it to absorb and hold large amounts of water. Concrete, as strong as it may seem, is actually extremely porous by nature comprised of multiple open pores and capillary voids. These open pores and voids allow water to penetrate and seep into a concrete foundation or slab causing all sorts of mold, mildew and efflorescence problems. So how do you prevent water, mold, mildew and efflorescence from traveling through your concrete?By using Lithi-Tek 9500 a deep penetrating concrete sealer, densifier and waterproofer, water and moisture intrusion is prevented from causing harmful damage. With an industry leading molecular nanotechnology formulation, the nano size particles allow for a deeper and more even disbursement. With a unique blend of silicate and siliconate molecules plus added enzymes and surfactants working in conjunction with one another, the silicate particles will penetrate and densify and chemically react to fill all the pores and voids from within, while the siliconate particles will chemically react with the carbon dioxide in the air to form an invisible waterproofing hydrophobic barrier that will not peel, flake or bubble.Lithi-Tek 9500 is an excellent product for poured concrete and concrete that will not be exposed to deicing salts; however, if you are looking to seal a substrate other than concrete such as brick, pavers or masonry or if you are looking for deicing salt and freeze-thaw protection the best product to use is the Sioxa-Tek 8500.

Stucco Concrete Sealer


						
							
								Stucco is an extremely porous concrete material much like brick. Since stucco is used in areas where there is a lot of salt in the air a silane or silane/ siloxane concrete sealer is going to be the best option. 
							
								
								By using a silane/siloxane concrete sealer, air borne salts will be kept out of the stucco protecting it against spalling and cracking.Product recommendation: The best stucco concrete sealer to use is the SILOXA-TEK 8500.Benefits: Benefits include protection from salts, water, efflorescence, mold and mildew.Coverage: Up to 250 square feet per gallon. Two coats are recommended and the listed coverage is per coat. Siloxa-Tek 8500 needs to be applied to stucco before it has been painted. If stucco has been painted the paint will need to be removed. You can paint stucco treated with the Siloxa-Tek 8500 concrete sealer seven days after sealing.Finish: Siloxa-Tek 8500 concrete sealer leaves a natural finish. Availability: Siloxa-Tek 8500 is available in a ready to use version or an ultra concentrated version.

How to Stop Concrete Sweating


						
							
								Concrete sweating usually occurs when warm air comes into contact with a cooler concrete slab and it causes the concrete floor to sweat. Continue reading to learn how to stop concrete sweating.
							
								
								After a humid night, water vapor in the air will come into contact with the cooler concrete floor and will condense into morning dew. What causes concrete to sweat?SSS or sweating slab syndrome is a phenomenon where moisture intermittently develops on the surface of an interior concrete slab. The combination of temperature swings and humidity build up cause the concrete to sweat.Why is concrete sweating problematic?Concrete sweating make concrete slippery and can be dangerous on larger concrete slabs with a lot of traffic.How to stop concrete sweatingDry out the room by air movement: a high volume low speed fan works well.Turn down the air conditioning/turn up the heat to keep the concrete floor temperature and the air temperature at similiar levels.Use a dehumidifier to remove moisture from the air and reduce the condensation.Use a penetrating sealer to seal the concrete and keep out moisture. We recommend using a concrete densifier first as a primer followed up  a penetrating stain repellent. It is important to use a penetrating concrete sealer as soon as possible so that you do not have to deal with mold or mildew issues which are a result of concrete sweating.

Concrete Water Sealers


						
							
							
								
								In order to seal concrete from the ever pestilent water problem you need to seal the slab from the inside out. By using Lithi-Tek 9500, a densifier, waterproofer and sealer, concrete is permanently protected. Lithi-Tek 9500 uses cutting edge molecular nanotechnology in its formula making it the go to product for the deepest penetration.Why should you use a sealer formulated using nanotechnology?Benefits of a molecularly engineered nanotechnology concrete sealer:Stronger, smaller, lighter nanoparticles are able to effectively penetrate deeper and chemically react more evenly.More accurate penetration and ability for the formulas to travel through all voids, pores and tracts, chemically bonding to the concrete.Smallest atomic structures possible, one thousand times smaller than the wavelengths of light, resulting from the manipulation of single nanoparticle molecules in finely controlled ways.Improved systems to control penetration and prevent/remediate water, mold, mildew, efflorescence, radon, hydrostatic pressure and water vapor transmission.Since the Lithi-Tek 9500 is a silicate/siliconate blended sealer it works by first seeping into concrete's micro cracks, pores and voids densifying and hardening concrete. The next chemical reaction that occurs is a reaction between the siliconate and the carbon dioxide creating an indestructible hydrophobic barrier. Concrete is left with a natural non-slip, non-yellowing surface with zero risk of delamination. Lithi-Tek 9500 is the most advanced, industrial strength, penetrating concrete waterproofing sealer ever formulated and it is guaranteed to outperform, outlive and outlast any other concrete sealer / waterproofing product.

Best Concrete Sealer for Winter


						
							
							
								
								Winter is a tremendously dangerous time for your concrete, as it also features the highest risk of potentially damaging threats. Whether it is the freeze/thaw cycle or the threat of excessive salt seeping into your concrete to upset the chemical balance, your concrete is especially vulnerable during the winter months. In order to best protect your concrete surfaces, especially those located outside in the elements all year long, you should use a concrete sealer to make sure there is no lasting damage suffered during the winter.To give, first, a slight overview of the potential threats, we turn to the threat posed by the freeze/thaw cycle. The freeze/thaw cycle is far more dangerous for your concrete that overexposure to salt. The excessive amounts of salt seeping into your garage floors or driveway are not good for your concrete, and will likely lead to future damage  but they are not quite as bad as the freeze/thaw cycle. The freeze/thaw cycle occurs when water seeps into the concrete slab in question during the warmer months in the Spring, Summer, and Fall. This water enters the slab through the tiny surface pores natural to all concrete before passing through the entire concrete via the microscopic network of pores and hairline cracks that extend through the slab. Once lodged within the concrete, the water will not easily be extracted. It will likely sit within the concrete until the winter, when it will freeze. With this freezing, comes expansion, and the concrete will crack to accommodate the larger amount of space taken up by the ice. When the ice thaws after the winter is over, the water will seep out of the concrete, leading to a contraction that will cause more cracking and crumbling. Essentially, after a devastating winter, concrete plagued by the freeze/thaw cycle will be cracked, crumbling, and degraded past any repair  indeed, its structural integrity will be entirely compromised.In order to best protect your concrete from the winter, you need to choose the best concrete sealer. If you need to protect concrete cinderblocks, brick, or stucco, you should choose a product like the Siloxa-Tek 8500, which is designed specifically for concrete that is more porous and more delicate. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 will create a hydrophobic barrier upon application that will help prevent water from entering the concrete, all while simultaneously protecting against too much salt diffusion during the winter.

Concrete Water Sealer


						
							
							
								
								Although it seems as if winter will never end, when the snow actually starts to melt basements are at high risk for flooding if a waterproofing concrete sealer, sump pump or other means of protection have not been implemented. Because of their close proximity to the water table, basement foundations are susceptible to large amounts of water vapor transmission and hydrostatic pressure. The best way of combating these forces is to use Lithi-Tek 9500.The unique blend of lithium silicate and siliconate in this formula and the use of molecular nano technology make it an industry leader. Why is nanotechnology important in a waterproofing concrete sealer? By deconstructing the atomic components of our sealer on the nanoscale vs. the macroscale, changed properties result from the changed size and structure. The manipulation of our nanoparticles and the way they are then structurally assembled results in the most technologically advanced and engineered formulations. Water moisture and migration are permanently ended. Lithi-Tek 9500 is an uniquely transparent, blended formula with added enzymes and surfactants that aide in accelerating a deeper penetrating disbursement. Thus eliciting a more effective, uniformed chemical reaction between our formula and the concrete / masonry substrate its being applied to.Unlike traditional silicates that only densify but do not combat water, our silicate/siliconate blend is penetrating and topical all-in-one without the chipping, flaking and delimitation common with topical sealers. By sealing from the inside out, concrete is densified, hardened, dust-proofed and resistant to mold, mildew, efflorescence, radon and of course water. The invisible hydrophobic barrier created from our formula will outperform, outlive and outlast any other concrete sealer / waterproofing product, guaranteed.

Concrete Countertop Sealer


						
							
							
								
								Concrete countertops are fast becoming a popular alternative to such other materials as laminate and granite for use in kitchens, workshops, and bathrooms. Granite typically is the high-cost material that offers such benefits as heat resistance and abrasion resistance, allowing you to place hot pots and pans, as well as cutting directly on the counter. Concrete countertops offer similar benefits to granite, all while being less expensive.Also, concrete can be sealed to prevent such problems as radon exposure, which has recently become a problem with granite. For this reason and many more, concrete countertops are becoming a popular choice for kitchens in homes and restaurants. However, concrete that is untreated with a concrete sealer can be at risk for many of the same problems that plague laminates and granites.Fortunately, there is an easy fix for this: simply apply  Countertop Sealer 660 to your concrete countertops if you are looking for a low sheen finish. Countertop Sealer 660 is an acrylic, water-based, non-toxic concrete sealer ideal for concrete countertops, integral sinks, fire places and furniture. Since Countertop Sealer 660 is water based it is food-safe and VOC free. This mix protects concrete from within while also creating a very thin, hard shell that acts as a barrier against chipping and etching from harsh acids and the wear and tear of everyday use. If you are looking for more of a natural finish, the best product to use is the Countertop Sealer 770. It will not change the look, finish or feel of the concrete countertops whatsoever; however, it will protect them against the pentration of water and fluids preventing staining.If you are looking for a high gloss finish and the most durable product possible that will resist chemicals and abrasions the best choice is the Polyaspartic 745. The Polyaspartic 745 is essentially a fast drying epoxy that is a coating which sits on the surface of the concrete countertop. It will leave a glossy finish but will completely keep out every stain possible and will never scratch, peel, flake or delaminate. Since the Polyasaprtic 745 can also be used on warehoues floors it is designed to repel forklift and heavy traffic. Before applying the Polyaspartic 745 it is best to sand down the countertop with a palm sander and 220 grit paper to rough up the concrete and prepare the countertop for the sealer.

Concrete Garage Sealers


						
							
							
								
								Garages are one of the most multifunctional spaces of a home. From housing cars, to being used as a storage unit, garage floors need to be able to withstand a multitude of fluids, abrasions and even chemicals. When it comes to sealing your concrete garage there are a few questions you want to ask before choosing the appropriate sealer.What are you looking to achieve? Chemical resistance, abrasion resistance or are you looking for protection from water, mold, mildew and/or dust?Are you looking for a decorative metallic or paint chip floor system or do you want the concrete to remain natural?If you are looking for chemical resistance, automobile fluid resistance abrasion resistance and want to stop concrete dusting with or without a decorative finish than your best bet would be to use an epoxy floor system. An epoxy floor system is comprised of an epoxy primer used in conjunction with a urethane top coat. You can add paint chips or metallic sand to these flooring systems or they are available clear or colored. Epoxy 325 and Urethane 645 formulas have been proven to be practically indestructible. They provide incredible abrasion resistance, chemical resistance, automobile fluid resistance and they are completely UV stable. We've created the ultimate protection for indoor areas with high risks of exposure to chemical spills, fuel, heavy equipment, extreme temperatures and any other potentially damaging situation the substrate may encounter.If you are looking to keep the concrete natural but still protected from abrasions, water, mold, mildew, efflorescence, and staining then your best bet would be to use Siloxa-Tek 8505 or Siloxa-Tek 8510. The Siloxa-Tek 8505 is water based and typically used in residential garages whereas the Siloxa-Tek 8510 is solvent based and typically used in industrial shop floors and warehouses. The Siloxa-Teks provide protection from deicing salts and staining from oils and greases without changing the look of the appearance of the concrete.

Basement Sealers


						
							
							
								
								Because of their close proximity to the water table, basements are most susceptible to water, mold, mildew, hydrostatic pressure and radon. When it comes to sealing a basement there are a few different routes you can take. You can hire a professional basement waterproofing company to come to your home, assess the damage and charge you an astronomical amount of money. Or you can use an industrial grade waterproofing sealer and do it yourself.When looking for a sealer to combat water, especially in a basement, it is imperative that you figure out where the water is coming from. Is water leaking through a large crack in the floor or through the cold seams? Or is water seeping through the floor or the walls? If the water is coming up through a crack or cold seam you need to seal it with an injectable epoxy or polyurethane solution that is able to combat large amounts of water pressure. If you are preventatively sealing a poured concrete foundation slab you'll want to use Lithi-Tek 9500. Lithi-Tek 9500 is a unique and proprietary formula that was formulated using molecular nanotechnology. This is important because nanoparticles are stronger, smaller and lighter to effectively penetrate deeper and chemically react more evenly. This allows the Lithi-Tek 9500 to travel through all voids, pores and tracts, chemically bonding to the concrete. The Lithi-Tek 9500 utilizes the smallest atomic structures possible, one thousand times smaller than the wavelengths of light, resulting from the manipulation of single nanoparticle molecules in finely controlled ways. These improved systems control penetration and prevent/remediate water, mold, mildew, efflorescence, radon, hydrostatic pressure and water vapor transmission. You will be hardpressed to find another sealer that performs so effectively, water will never again be an issue in your basement. If you are not using Lithi-Tek 9500 you are not properly sealing and permanently waterproofing your basement.However if you are sealing a poured concrete foundation that has already expereinced some seepage or moisture it is best to use a two step process. First use the Lithi-Tek 4500 as a primer and then use the Siloxa-Tek 8500 as a top coat. The combination of the two products will combat mositure intrusion, organic growth and efflorescence. If water is coming in through concrete blocks or cinderblocks then you need to use Siloxa-Tek 8500 as a stand alone product. Because of the porosity of the concrete blocks it will provide the most effective seal.

Best Sealer for Hot Tire Pickup


						
							
							
								
								Much has been said about hot tire pickup and the damage it causes to concrete garages, driveways and parking lots. What is hot tire pick up? Hot tire pickup occurs after hot tires cool down and sink into the concrete causing peeling or delamination of a coating where the tire meets the concrete. Over time this change in temperature causes a coating that is not hot tire pickup resistant to fail. In order to prevent this from happening it is imperative that you apply an industrial grade concrete coating to the concrete. By using Epoxy 325 in conjunction with Urethane 645, hot tire pickup will no longer be a problem. Using Epoxy 325 alone will protect the concrete and provide chemical and abrasion resistance but in order to make the coating completely undestroyable apply Urethane 645 on top of the Epoxy 325 for unbeatable protection.Since Urethane 645 is an aliphatic polyester blend it is practically indestructible providing incredible abrasion resistance, chemical resistance and of course hot tire pickup resistance while remaining UV stable. If there are already tire marks on the concrete before a coating is applied you need to make sure the concrete is clean with a rough surface porosity in order for the coating to adequately adhere. Even if you have not had an issue with tire marks you need to make sure the concrete is clean with a rough surface porosity to accept the coating. Improper surface preparation can result in a coating failing if the floor is not clean enough to receive the coating. You also need to make sure there are no withstanding moisture issues since moisture can also cause delamination.

Concrete Waterproofing


						
							
							
								
								One of the most common problems our technical support team here at Kretetek hears about on a daily basis is water. Water entering a basement, water seeping through walls and preventing water from  damaging a driveway to name a few. So how do you prevent, protect and waterproof your concrete? That is where the Ghostshield formulas come into play. The Ghostshield formulas utilize molecular nano technology to penetrate and seep deep into the pores, voids and capillary tracts of a concrete slab. Since the nano particles in the formulas are so small in size they are able to travel through the concrete filling in all of the empty space and rendering the concrete hydrophobic. Since concrete is an extremely porous material it is extremely susceptible to water seepage if not properly sealed.For an easy and cost effective solution, Lithi-Tek 9500 is an excellent choice. Lithi-Tek 9500 is a penetrating densifier and waterproofering sealer. Through penetration the silicate molecules densify, harden and provide protection from within, while through topical protection the siliconate molecules react at the surface with the carbon dioxide in the air forming a hydrophobic barrier preventing any water from entering through the surface. It is a great option for poured concrete substrates but is not recommended for brick, stone, masonry or cinderblocks. The Lithi-Tek 9500 is a concentrated product and is mixed with 4 gallons of water prior to sealing which makes for If you are looking for a waterproofing sealer that can be used on multiple substrates the Siloxa-Tek 8500 is an excellent choice. Siloxa-Tek 8500 is a penetrating water repellent and deicing salt repellent so it is frequently used on driveway applications to keep out harmful deicing salts that cause spalling, pitting and cracking. It is also used in basements in conjunction with the Lithi-Tek 4500 primer - by using the Lithi-Tek 4500 product first as a primer, waiting seven days and applying the Siloxa-Tek 8500 as a topcoat.If you are looking for a waterproofing sealer and deicing salt repellent that can be used on multiple substrates AND will give staining protection from oils, greases, fluids and leaves the best product to use is the Siloxa-Tek 8505 (if you are looking for a water based product) or Siloxa-Tek 8510 (if you are looking for a solvent based product).

Best Concrete Sealer for a Stucco House


						
							
							
								
								If you have a home constructed from stucco, you are probably wondering what steps you can take to protect it from the elements. Traditional concrete basements, floors, and foundations are obvious candidates for concrete sealers, but what about homes made of stucco? Fortunately, you can use a concrete sealer on stucco, which will function just as effectively as on traditional concrete; however, it is important to choose the right variety of concrete sealer.The problem lies in the fact that stucco is a more porous concrete material. Being more delicate than traditional concrete, whose small pores dot solid gray facades that we typically associate with concrete in our minds, stucco requires a concrete sealer that offers better protection for more delicate forms of concrete. Stucco itself is similar enough to concrete that the same basic types of concrete sealers can be used.The best choice in concrete sealer for homes made of stucco is a silane/siloxane sealer. The silane/siloxane sealer uses particles of silane and particles of siloxane to both penetrate within the stucco and to bond to the surface. This dual action creates a hydrophobic barrier that will protect the stucco from water, salts, and other environmental threats to the stuccos visual appeal and structural integrity. The best silane/siloxane offering on the market is the Siloxa-Tek 8500. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 offers the most comprehensive level of protection out of all silane/siloxane sealers, featuring an extended warranty and excellent characteristics of resistance to water and the elements.

How to Seal a Walk-In Freezer


						
							
							
								
								If you own a business or even a home with a walk-in freezer, chances are the floors are made of concrete. Concrete is an incredibly versatile and strong material that makes an excellent surface for environments as varied as bridge foundations to the floors of walk-in freezers. However, concrete also has some drawbacks. For all of its legendary strength and durability, it is susceptible to various structural and aesthetic problems over the course of its life.One of the biggest threats can come from moisture damage. While most freezers do not leak regularly, there still is the potential threat of a broken freezer leading to pools of water throughout the floor. These pools of water can seep into unprotected concrete, entering into the vast maze of microscopic cracks and pores through the tiny pores on the surface of the slab. Once the water is in the concrete, it is nearly impossible to remove it. Fortunately, there exists an easy solution that is both efficient and cost-effective.Concrete sealers are excellent products that will offer comprehensive protection for your freezer floors. They will help protect from water damage, but they also will help increase the concretes slip resistance and resistance to abrasions. However, you cannot just apply a concrete sealer to a freezer. First, you will need to turn off the freezer, allowing the room (and the surface of the concrete) to warm until it reaches a temperature of fifty degrees Fahrenheit. Once this temperature is reached, you can apply the sealer.For a concrete floor in a freezer, your best choice is the Ghostshield Lithi-Tek 9500. The Lithi-Tek 9500 is a penetrating sealer whose particles of silicate will penetrate past the surface of the concrete to spread throughout the slab. Once inside the slab, the particles of sealant will react chemically with the minerals already present within the concrete. The result of these reactions will be a strengthening and densification of the concrete while simultaneously protecting the concrete from water damage.

Best Concrete Sealers for Bridges


						
							
							
								
								Bridges are incredibly important, and they are accordingly built typically from concrete. Concrete, one of the strongest, most long-lasting, and most reliable man-made materials on Earth, is an excellent choice for bridge foundations. If bridges were not so strong, they could conceivably collapse at random, which would be disastrous and devastating. While bridges can collapse, and some certainly have, they are the exception, rather than the rule.However, Americas infrastructure is slowly crumbling, built largely in the 1950s and 1960s. Without the proper maintenance and the lack of funding to properly care for the various highways and bridges, the future of Americas infrastructure could potentially be at risk. The easiest way to remedy this failing is to apply a quality concrete sealer on the concrete bridge foundations.For concrete bridge foundations, the best concrete sealer would be a silane/siloxane blend. The Ghostshield Siloxa-Tek 8500 is an excellent product that yields excellent results when applied to bridge foundations. Featuring a hydrophobic barrier, the silane/siloxane would block out water, not allowing it to penetrate within the concrete. Once in the concrete, water can remain there until the winter when it freezes until the spring when it thaws  these freeze/thaw cycles can lead to incredible damage and cracks, which can crumble even more over the years. The best way to prevent this is to prevent water from entering the concrete, which would be accomplished through the use of the Siloxa-Tek 8500.

Best Sealer for Concrete Steps


						
							
							
								
								If your home or building features concrete steps, youre probably looking for a concrete sealing product to protect those steps to prolong their life. Without adequate protection, the concrete can warp, crack, spall, corrode, crumble, and degrade in a variety of other ways. While this can happen slowly over time, it can also happen quickly, depending on the environmental and situational conditions surrounding your concrete steps.These steps, however, once properly treated, are sure to last for an extended period of time. Concrete is a naturally durable material that has been purported to last for tens of thousands of years  long beyond what any human being, or any generations of human beings, would ever need a structure for. Therefore, it is extremely cost effective and in your best interests to treat your concrete steps with a concrete sealer if you wish to prevent any problems and potentially costly repairs in the future.The best concrete sealer for concrete steps would be a silane/siloxane variety. The silane/siloxane type of concrete sealer combines particles of silane and particles of siloxane in one solution. When applied properly, the solutions particles of silane penetrate past the surface, working in conjunction with the particles of siloxane that pool on the surface of the concrete, due to their larger particle size. These particles then form a hydrophobic barrier between the concrete and the exterior world, which helps to prevent the incursion of water, deicing salts, or other dirt and debris, increasing the structural integrity of your concrete steps. The best silane/siloxane sealer offering on the market today is the Siloxa-Tek 8500. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 is a water-based offering that will help increase the UV stability, slip resistance, and water resistance of your concrete steps, preventing cracks and degradation over the course of the steps lives.

Best Sealer for Stucco Near Salt-Water


						
							
							
								
								Stucco is another porous concrete material similar to brick. Therefore, it has the same basic composition, qualities, and characteristics of brick, which for our purposes are mostly that the two types of concrete are more delicate and decorative. Despite the differences, stucco is similar to concrete and calls for the same type of concrete sealers to be used to protect stucco slabs and facades.Many stucco facades are attached to homes that are near the ocean or other large salt bodies of water. These bodies of water pose a debilitating double threat: the water from the storms can seep into the stucco, eating away at the its strength and structural integrity, and the salt from the breezes can similarly corrode the material. Therefore, it is almost imperative that you use a concrete sealer for your stucco if you live near a body of salt water.The best option to seal stucco is the Siloxa-Tek 8510 (solvent based) or the Siloxa-Tek 8500 (water based). These sealers use particles of silane and siloxane to penetrate into the stucco while simultaneously bonding to the surface of the substrate to create a hydrophobic barrier to lock out water and salt.

Urethane Coatings


						
							
							
								
								Urethane coatings are by far one of the most chemically resistant sealers protecting indoor and outdoor areas with high risks of exposure to chemical spills and fuel. Urethanes are commonly used in garages and warehouses, industrial facilities, aircraft hangers, auto service centers, laboratories, restaurants, food prep kitchens and exterior tanks to name a few. What makes urethane coatings, especially aliphatic urethanes the ideal solution for these applications is their abrasion resistance and durability.By far, the longest lasting urethane, resisting the most chemicals and abrasions is Urethane 645. Urethane 645 is a 65% solids two component clear polyester/aliphatic polyurethane coating. Combining the highest quality of polyester and aliphatic polyurethanes we could source, our chemist set out to formulate an aliphatic urethane that would out last, out perform and be twice as resilient as any other aliphatic urethane on the market today. To our success Formula 645 was born and Urethane 645 was created. This formula has proven to be practically indestructible. It provides incredible abrasion resistance, chemical resistance and is UV stable. Weve created the ultimate protection for indoor and outdoor areas with high risks of exposure to chemical spills, fuel, heavy equipment, extreme temperatures and any other potentially damaging situation your substrate may encounter.UNSURPASSED ADVANTAGES:Formulated to protect and beautify concreteHigh performance formulaStops DustingExcellent choice for warehouse and industrial floorsExcellent hardnessExcellent abrasion resistanceExcellent chemical resistanceExcellent flexibilityAvailable clear or coloredMore durable, scratch and scruff resistant than other traditional urethanesEasy to use and apply, labor-cost effective

Waterproofing Sealers


						
							
							
								
								Much has been said over the years about water and concrete. Even though this usually structurally sound building material is composed of water, water is also its kryptonite. Since concrete is made up of thousands of capillary pores and voids, there are numerous outlets for water to travel through. And with concrete basements being so close to the water table, this leads to a lot of wet and musty spaces.In order to prevent the aforementioned from occurring there are a few measures that can be taken. First use a lithium silicate/siliconate sealer. The best thing about our industry leading, industrial grade sealer is it can be used as soon as the concrete is poured and set. By using this Lithi-Tek 9500 as a cure and seal on newly poured concrete you are immediately remedying and preventing the water problem. If haven't heard of Lithi-Tek 9500 until now, don't worry there is hope for your basement/concrete too. Lithi-Tek 9500 can also be applied to old concrete. As long as the surface is clean and there is adequate surface porosity this sealer will densify, harden, prevent mold, mildew, efflorescence and radon.Since the Lithi-Tek 9500 can only be used on poured concrete substrates, if you are looking to seal brick, masonry, stone, concrete blocks, or any areas that will be exposed to deicing salts (such as a garage or driveway) the best product to use is a product from the Siloxa-Tek line. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 is an excellent choice for all substrates especially for deicing salt protection. The Siloxa-Tek 8505 (water based) is an excellent choice for deicing salt protection and staining protection from oils, greases and leaves, whereas the Siloxa-Tek 8510 will give you all the benefits of the Siloxa-Tek 8505 but it is in a solvent carrier.

Concrete Sealer Densifiers


						
							
							
								
								Concrete densifiers are a must have and one of the most commonly requested sealers in the concrete industry. Have you ever seen the gorgeous smooth polished floors of a big box hardware store? In order to achieve this look you apply a concrete densifier and then polish the concrete to a nice sheen. When you apply a densifier to raw concrete it seeps into all of the pores and the capillary voids creating a harder, denser concrete surface. This creates the ideal environment for the next step, polishing. You want the concrete to be as hard as possible since if you were to grind or polish the floor without first using a densifier the concrete would be more apt to deterioration.Concrete densifiers are of a silicate chemistry - of either a lithium, sodium or potassium carrier. Sodium silicates have been around for over a century and were the first original densifiers. The problem many people have when applying a silicate sealer to concrete is a problem of whitening, or surface bloom. This can result with over application and it leaves an unsightly concrete appearance. Sodium silicates are excellent for densifying because if over application whitening occurs it will be polished off when you polish the floors. Lithium silicates are also excellent densifiers, of a newer technology that creates an even stronger and more beautiful finish. By using a concrete densifier and then polishing the concrete, dusting will be non-existent.Ghostshield offers two state of the art options for densifying concrete: Sila-Tek 3500 and Lithi-Tek 4500. What sets these two sealers apart from other concrete densifiers on the market is their molecular nano technology formulas and the constant evolution the formulas undergo. Many companies have been selling and using the same sealers for decades without changing the formulas. The Ghostshield products are constantly improving to offer consumers the most advanced concrete densifiers available.

Concrete Waterproofers


						
							
							
								
								What do you need to look for when choosing a concrete waterproofer? Concrete waterproofing sealers are the most effective solutions as long as you choose the correct product formulation. For many years silicates have been pushed as the concrete waterproofing products of choice. However, it cannot be said enough that silicates are densifiers. They will harden, strengthen, densify and seal concrete but they will not waterproof your home.In order for a sealer to effectively waterproof it needs to be a blended silicate/siliconate formulation. What is so unique and special is the reaction the two parts of this formula have when used in conjunction. The small atomic structure of the silicate molecule penetrates, chemically reacts and densifys concrete. By filling in cracks, pores and capillary voids concrete is strengthened and permanently sealed. That is where the siliconate molecule comes into play. With its slightly larger molecular size and its penetrating topical nature, it fills in any pockets the silicate might have missed while also creating an invisible waterproofing barrier. Water, moisture, mold, mildew and efflorescence are all stopped while still remaining breathable. Since the blended silicate/siliconate penetrates it remains breathable and resistant to peeling, flaking, chipping or bubbling.Ghostshield Lithi-Tek 9500 is the most advanced lithium silicate/siliconate blend sealer available today. Formulated and developed to fill the void (no pun intended) traditional silicates left with their false waterproofing claims, you will not be disappointed or left with a product that does not work. We guarantee that Lithi-Tek 9500 will solve all your water and moisture issues if properly applied and maintained.

Concrete Coatings


						
							
							
								
								What is the difference between concrete sealers and concrete coatings? A sealer is usually classified as a penetrating solution that will lock out moisture, mold, mildew and efflorescence leaving a natural looking concrete slab. A coating on the other hand is usually classified as an industrial strength solution that is built up on top of the concrete protecting through layers of material. Concrete coatings are excellent choices for warehouses, food prep kitchens, aircraft hangers, laboratories and shop floors to name a few. When looking for an industrial strength concrete coating you want to make sure the coating has excellent hardness, protection from abrasions and uv rays while also having chemical resistance properties and being extremely adherent.The first step to take when thinking about a concrete coating is preparation. You need to make sure the coating can adhere to the surface so it is recommended to use a floor grinder like an EDCO grinder or a Clark floor machine commonly found at big box retail outlets with at least an 80 grit pad. Once the surface is ready for application, an epoxy concrete primer like Epoxy 325 is the best option for a high build floor. It will add a protective layer aiding in better adhesion for the next coat in the system.Ghostshield  Urethane 645has been the go to choice for contractors and homeowners looking for a reliable, durable, industrial grade solution. What sets Urethane 645 apart from the competition is its extreme chemical resistance characteristics and its ability to protect concrete with the aforementioned properties. Abrasions and chemicals have no chance at destroying this coating.nThis formula has proven to be practically indestructible. Urethane 645 is the ultimate protector for indoor areas with high risks of exposure to chemical spills, fuel, heavy equipment, extreme temperatures and any other potentially damaging situation your substrate may encounter.

Acrylic Concrete Sealers


						
							
							
								
								What are acrylic concrete sealers? Acrylic sealers are film forming decorative concrete sealers. Acrylic concrete sealers leave a low sheen or wet look finish. They are available in a water-based version or a solvent-based version. What is the different between solvent-based acrylic sealers and water-based acrylic sealers? Solvent based acrylic sealers last longer and perform better than water-based acrylic sealers. They leave a wet look, high gloss finish and can be used with matte additives and slip resistant additives. Solvent-based acrylic sealers will enhance the colors and textures of any substrate you apply them to. Water-based acrylic sealers leave a low sheen or satin finish and do not offer much color enahancement. Water-based sealers have lower VOC and are environmentally friendly products meeting VOC regulations in all 50 states.
								Why Ghostshield?
								If you are looking for a high gloss, wet look finish sealer to enhance the colors and textures of concrete use the CRYLI-TEK 5505. The Cryli-Tek 5505 is a methacrylate acrylic concrete sealer that will not delaminate or yellow due to wear and UV light exposure and will leave a wet-look finish for years to come. If you are looking for a low sheen, satin finish sealer consider adding the Matting Agent 5000 to the Cryli-Tek 5505. The Matting Agent 5000 is mixed into the Cryli-Tek 5505 and will reduce the sheen to a low sheen or satin finish.If you are looking for a slip-resistant additive use the Grip-Tek 250. The Grip-Tek 250 is mixed into the Cryli-Tek 5505 and will add traction to make the concrete sealer less slippery when wet. If you are looking for a water based acrylic concrete sealer use the CRYLI-TEK 5500.

Penetrating Concrete Sealers


						
							
							
								
								Concrete sealers can usually be classified as either penetrating or topical. Topical sealers are usually of the acrylic, epoxy or urethane variety, as its name suggests sitting on top of the concrete. Penetrating sealers, as its name suggests, penetrate deep into the concrete chemically reacting or impregnating to seal from the inside out.Penetrating sealers most commonly come in the form of silicates, siliconates, silanes, siloxanes or blends: Sodium silicates have been around for almost a century and are an excellent choice for densifying concrete, however keep in mind that sodium silicates are not waterproofers. They may densify and strenghten but they will not be effective against active water or moisture intrusion. Product recommendation: Sila-Tek 3500Lithium silicates are a newer densifying technology with added benefits of combating ASR, and deeper penetration than a sodium silicate. Product recommendation: Lithi-Tek 4500Silicate/Siliconates: are a blend of a silicate densifier and a siliconate waterproofer. The combination of the two products strengthens and hardenes concrete filling in all the tiny pores and capillary voids, while the siliconate component renders a hydrophobic surface environment resisting water, mold, mildew and efflorescence. Product recommendation: Lithi-Tek 9500Silane/Siloxanes: are a blend of silanes and siloxanes which are excellent choices when used as water and salt repellents. Some variations also include a fluro polymer which makes them resistant to oils and staining from grease and leaves. Product recommendations: Siloxa-Tek 8500, Siloxa-Tek 8505, Siloxa-Tek 8510

Waterproofing Concrete Sealers


						
							
							
								
								One of the most common problems plaguing homeowners, contractors and industry professionals alike are water and moisture issues. Basements are usually the most common application for these water problems since the basement is located in close proximity to the water table. There are thousands of products on the market that claim to waterproof and solve all of your water and moisture problems.In order to find a product that will truly waterproof you need to look for an industrial grade penetrating sealer. A silicate/siliconate blended sealer will be your best option because of the blend of the smaller silicate molecule and the larger siliconate molecule. The silicate solution will penetrate into the concrete densifying, strengthening and hardening from within, filling all the pores and capillary voids. The siliconate molecule, while also a penetrating component will fill in any pores left unfilled while also providing an invisible water repellent coating on the surface thus waterproofing while remaining breathable.Ghostshield Lithi-Tek 9500 is a state of the art, industrial grade lithium silicate/siliconate blended sealer that is unrivaled and industry leading. Other benefits include:Prevents water and moisture intrusionBecomes an integral part of the concrete, forming a complete body of strength and durability with 100% of the results occurring below the surfacePenetrates deeply and seals concretes capillary tracts and shrinkage cracks preventing the growth of mold and mildew and the spread of radon.Resists the spread of vapor transmissionIncreases concretes compressive strengthCombats Alkali Silica Reaction (ASR)Efflorescence attacks are prevented1 gallon is concentrated making 5 gallons, covering up to 1000 square feetSeals hairline and shrinkage cracks rather than merely masking or bridging themWaterproofing and chemical-resistance properties remain intact even if the surface is damagedDries clear. The color and look of the concrete will not change after sealing resulting in 100% transparent and non-slip surfacesEasy to apply, labor-cost effective.Nontoxic, Low VOCs and no harmful fumes.

Concrete Floor Sealer


						
							
							
								
								Concrete has always been used as a building material in residential homes and interior and exterior commercial buildings. Commercial buildings are usually always sealed since the contractor and/or builder knows that it is imperative that the floors be sealed in order to protect them and extend their wear life. Homeowners on the other hand may choose to forgo the sealing when building a new home. They might think it is not cost effective or unimportant or when the time comes that there is a problem that is when they are going to seal their concrete.On the contrary, it is vital when building a home or moving into a new home that you seal all the concrete. Even if you have lived in your house for many years and have not had any problems it is still crucial that you seal the concrete. Concrete is essentially a large porous sponge filled with tiny cracks and capillary voids that allow water, moisture, mold, mildew and efflorescence to travel throughout the slab. If you leave concrete untreated there is an extreme potential for all of those conditions to come to life.The best decision you can ever make when it comes to sealing residential or commercial floors is to use a Ghostshield concrete sealer:Lithi-Tek 9500  is an industrial grade, industry leading solution. The most advanced concrete sealer, densifier and waterproofer available. What sets it apart is its lithium silicate/siliconate blended molecular nano-technology formula and its ability to prevent mold, mildew, efflorescence, radon and moisture transmission while also sealing, hardening, strengthening and densifying concrete. An excellent choice if you are looking for a cost effective solution.Siloxa-Tek 8505 is a great choice if you are looking for any sort of deicing salt resistance and staining protection - resitance from household fluids and condiments, and resistance from oils and greases in industrial environments. The Siloxa-Tek 8505 is water based, but if you are looking for a higher performing solvent based counterpart the Siloxa-Tek 8510 is an excellent choice.

Wine Cellar Sealer


						
							
							
								
								Wine cellars are part of a home or business that usually do not get as much attention as more highly trafficked areas. Unlike a garage or a traditional basement, they are hardly integral to the structure or function of your home or business. However, they can house an expensive and valuable collection of wine that often requires perfect environmental conditions to ensure the preservation of the liquids.Most wine cellars, like regular cellars and basements, are constructed from concrete. A strong, durable material, concrete can last forever and will protect your interior from the perils of the outdoors. However, concrete is far from a solid material. While it is extremely strong, concrete is also incredibly porous, which is a direct result of its mixing process. Concrete is really just a mixture of a few different materials that bind together to create the final material we call concrete. A by-product of this mixing process is a large number of holes and tiny air pockets that fill the concrete, making it porous and susceptible to the passage of water or potentially harmful natural gases like methane and radon.Concrete that has just been poured and cured, even properly cured, will not be up to its optimal potential strength. Instead, that concrete needs to be treated with a concrete sealer. A wine cellar requires a quality concrete sealer more than a typical basement, as its contents tend to be more precious than those of the average basement.For a concrete wine cellar, the best choice would be a silane/siloxane sealer with stain resistance, like Siloxa-Tek 8505 or Siloxa-Tek 8510 (a higher performing, solvent based version of the 8505). The Siloxa-Tek's contain particles that will penetrate into the concrete material past the surface pores, filling the porous holes and hairline cracks with its material. This protects the concrete from the incursion of water, and the passage of moisture keeping the concrete completely dry. The Siloxa-Tek sealers will also seal the surface of the concrete, working on both levels to protect your wine cellar. An added benefit is the addition of a proprietary fluropolymer which gives resistance to staining, so if any wine were to spill on the concrete it would allow for easy clean-up.

Best Sealer for Concrete Stairs


						
							
							
								
								Concrete stairs can be an important part of your home, depending on the layout. While many people choose to install wooden stairs, the concrete variety is gaining in popularity as they last significantly longer without the typical maintenance headaches presented by wooden stairs. Concrete stairs will exhibit excellent strength and longevity simply by virtue of being made from concrete. However, they will not achieve their maximum strength potential unless they are treated with a concrete sealer. Concrete sealers are designed and manufactured to work in conjunction with many forms of concrete (all forms, actually, though each form will require a different type of concrete sealer).Concrete stairs are likely found outdoors, exposed to the elements that can destroy them over the course of their lives. The degradation can be insidious, happening slowly over time without your knowledge, or the degradation can be overt and fast-acting, such as if your concrete stairs are affected by the freeze/thaw cycle. Water damage is one of the most devastating sources of damage that can plague concrete, and constant exposure to the outdoors means you have to take the necessary steps to protect your concrete from water, ice, snow, the sun, dirt, debris, and other potentially harmful by-products of weather.A concrete water and deicing salt repellent like the Siloxa-Tek 8500 is the best choice for concrete stairs, especially if these stairs are located outside on a front entry way or in an in-between space, such as leading up to a basement bulkhead. The 8500 product is able to repel deicing salts that are commonly used on steps to protect the concrete from spalling, pitting, cracking and freeze-thaw cycle damage.The Siloxa-Tek 8500 fundamentally enhances the concretes longevity and lasts upwards of ten years before another application is needed. If you are also looking for stain protection from oils, greases and leaves an excellent option is the Siloxa-Tek 8505 (water based) or Siloxa-Tek 8510 (solvent based).

Concrete Roof Tile Sealer


						
							
							
								
								The roof of a house is probably the most important element to any shelter; its not for nothing that the phrase is a roof over ones head. In spite of the shared wisdom and obviousness of this fact, roofs are often neglected, forgotten about, and denied the proper care. Whether this is due to forgetfulness or ignorance, you should not fall prey to this potential disastrous mistake. Regardless of whether your roof is made up of tiles or shingles, as long as these materials are comprised of concrete, there are steps you need to take to ensure an appropriate level of protection.Fortunately, the process is fairly easy, straightforward, and cost-effective. A roof made of tiles is likely to leak at some point over the course of its life. If moisture seeps into the concrete material, it will definitely leak into your home over time. Concrete is a naturally porous material, which is a direct result of its mixing process. It is created by mixing together water, Portland cement, and an aggregate, such as sand or gravel. These three materials lead to a large number of microscopic pores and hairline cracks that extend throughout the concrete in a vast network that is ideal for allowing water to pass through.Fortunately, it is easy to protect your concrete roof tiles thereby protecting your home from water damage. The best, most cost-effective method is to apply a concrete sealer to your roof in order to prevent water leakage. Siloxa-Tek 8500 is the best option to protect your roof, without the risk of fading or delamination. It is a penetrating sealer that will enter the concrete through surface pores without changing the look, feel or appearance of the tiles. Penetrating concrete sealers like the 8500 are an inexpensive and straightforward way to prevent future damage to your roof all while helping to prevent mold, mildew, efflorescence, and other problems that can threaten a roof's integrity.

How to Apply Concrete Dye 


						
							
							
								
								If you ever find yourself faced with a concrete slab that is too drab and bland for its surrounding environment, you will need to know how to add some visual appeal to the concrete. One of the best ways to do this is to use a concrete dye. Concrete dyes come in a number of vibrant colors, such as blue, yellow, and red. Furthermore, they can be mixed together on-site to create other colors according to the traditional color wheel. For instance, you can create a green dye by mixing blue and yellow, or purple by mixing red and blue. The flexibility and variety of the dyes makes for an inexpensive and effective way of coloring your concrete.The dyes themselves are translucent with small particles that allow the substance to penetrate within the concrete. It is important to remember that they will not conceal or cover over unwanted colors or stains. However, for an unmarked surface of concrete, the dyes are a perfect choice. They can also be added to a previously colored concrete surface, though you must be aware that the colors will blend together. Because they are penetrating, they are extremely easy to apply, and their small particles ensure little residue left over after the application.

Concrete Driveway Sealers


						
							
							
								
								One of the most important aspects of your home, especially as they are primarily the first part of your home seen by those who drive by, is the driveway. Most driveways, especially in warmer areas without yearly snows, are made of concrete and not asphalt. If you own a home in a warmer climate, or even if you own a home in a colder climate that already has a concrete driveway, you should treat your driveway with a concrete sealer to protect the concrete and ensure its strength and durability.Concrete sealers will help to restore your concrete driveway, protecting it from water, salt, UV radiation, and other such harmful aspects of environmental conditions. An untreated concrete driveway will crack and discolor, allowing weeds and grass to grow up through the cracks, making your home look far worse by association. Fortunately, the fix for such problems is cost effective and easy to apply. A quality concrete sealer will ensure lasting protection for your concrete.For an outdoor concrete driveway that is exposed to deicing salts, you'll want to use a concrete sealer like a silane/siloxane-based concrete sealer. A silane/siloxane sealer is one that contains small silane/siloxane particles that will penetrate through the small pores on the surface of the concrete to react chemically within the material. The particles will bond with existing chemicals and minerals within the concrete to densify and protect the concrete from water seepage, cracks, and various other potential harms. Siloxa-Tek 8500 is a high-quality concrete sealer option that is easy to apply by following the basic instructions, and it consists of a strong ratio of silane/siloxane particles-to-water, ensuring your concrete gets the best protection possible. If you are looking for all the benefits of the Siloxa-Tek 8500 with additional resistance to staining from oils, greases and leaves the best product to use would be the Siloxa-Tek 8505 or the Siloxa-Tek 8510. The main difference between the two products is that the Siloxa-Tek 8505 is water based and the Siloxa-Tek 8510 is solvent based. The solvent based Siloxa-Tek 8510 tends to last longer and perform better than the Siloxa-Tek 8505. If you live in an area where deicing salts are not used on the roadways and are looking for a cost-effective solution the best product to use is the Lithi-Tek 9500. The 9500 is an excellent choice because it is a concentrated product that is mixed with 4 gallons of water to make a 5 gallon bucket of sealer. It is easily applied with a garden variety pump sprayer and will help to prevent the growth of mold and mildew making driveways easier to clean.

Concrete Densifier


						
							
							
								
								Concrete densifiers are products that help increase the density of concrete slabs. While the name is obvious, the process by which the concrete becomes densified is not that intuitive. These products are essential to the structural integrity and proper functioning of many types of concrete slabs, especially before such process as polishing concrete.Polishing concrete, for example, is a process that requires the application of a concrete densifier. The best concrete densifier on the market today is the Lithi-Tek 4500 which is a lithium silicate - stronger and better performing than sodium silicates.The Lithi-Tek 4500 contains small particles of sealant that seep through the tiny surface pores natural to all concrete during the application process. Once within the concrete, the sealant particles will travel through the extensive network of microscopic pores and hairline cracks, reacting chemically to form more calcium silicate hydrate (CSH), which is the crucial natural element to concretes strength. With even more CSH present in the concrete after a concrete densifier is applied, the concrete is both denser and less prone to potential damage from water.The Lithi-Tek 4500, aside from being used in the polishing process, is commonly used as a primer before the application of the Siloxa-Tek 8500, 8505 or 8510 and the Lithi-Tek 9500. When using a primer, it helps to increase the performance of a waterproofing sealer (like the 8500, 8505, 8510 and 9500) by filling in the smaller pores and capillary tracts of the concrete in which water and moisture usually travel.

How to Burnish Concrete 


						
							
								Polishing or burnishing concrete floors rids the concrete of any surface imperfections and degradations, leaving behind a smooth surface unmarked by any damage leaving the the floors looking like the concrete floors at Home Depot and Lowes.
							
								
								If it wasn’t for the burnishing process, polished concrete floors would be dull and lackluster. The process can be an excellent choice for warehouses that need a smooth floor or for residential interior concrete floors.Burnish refers to the finish. A burnished finish requires troweling the slab to the point where it appears very smooth and glossy.How to Burnish Concrete:Apply a concrete densifier. The concrete densifier will increase the strength and density of the concrete substrate before polishing. Polish the concrete. Burnish the surface using a burnishing machine with a certain level of grit pad. If this is your first time burnishing, you need to begin with a 1500-or 2000-grit pad. A higher grit count will ultimately result in a glossier concrete surface.While the process is not difficult, be sure to proceed slowly and with caution. Over-burnishing your concrete surface can result in a nasty and unpleasant visual faade, as well as potential structural deficiencies. However, if you slowly run the burnishing machine over the concrete surface evenly, you will be fine. However, the number of times can depend on your own discretion, though the more frequent the burnishing, the more glossy the surface.Burnishing is the final step in the polishing process to bring out the glossy sheen of polished concrete. 
								Why Ghostshield?
								LITHI-TEK 4500 is the most advanced concrete densifier available. This clear penetrating sealer not only densifies and hardens concrete making it up to 50% stronger, but it the go to choice to harden and prime basements and driveways. Because of its lithium silicate based chemistry, it is also an excellent choice to strenghten concrete floors before polishing.

Epoxy Coatings


						
							
							
								
								Epoxies are solutions that need to be mixed together prior to application. Once mixed, they contain large particles of chemical sealant that are applied to a concrete surface. Once applied to the concrete surface, the large particles of sealant will pool on said surface, as they are too large to penetrate past the tiny surface pores natural to all concrete. They merely sit atop the surface of the concrete to be spread out evenly during the application process.Once spread out evenly, the particles of sealant will adhere to the concrete substrate, creating a nigh unbreakable bond that will last a significant amount of time. These epoxy coatings, when properly applied, will offer excellent resistance to abrasions, heat, UV rays, and a variety of other potential problems. They will leave concrete surfaces smooth and protected, and you can even add some visual pizzazz to the concrete with the possibility of adding paint chips or metallic sand.Because they are easy to apply and easy to maintain, they are often the concrete coatings of choice for most retail stores, as well as airports and warehouses. They offer an excellent level of comprehensive protection that lasts for a significant amount of time. The best epoxy coating on the market is the Epoxy 325, a water-based product that has a low volatile organic content, making it safe and legal for application. Its propriety blend of chemicals has created a product that offers superior protection from excessive heat, abrasions and resistance to chemical spills.

Concrete Block Sealer


						
							
							
								
								Building with concrete blocks has become less and less popular over the past few years. Once the typical material used in basements, newer homes and buildings are increasingly built with poured concrete. However, if you have an older building, you likely have a basement constructed primarily with concrete blocks.One of the biggest drawbacks to concrete blocks is their perceptibility to moisture and water seepage. Because they are so porous, water easily finds it way underneath the surface, sitting in the numerous air pockets to fester and eventually spawn mold, mildew, and other issues.The best way to prevent this type of problem is by sealing your concrete blocks. However, while concrete blocks are largely made from concrete, they are similar to brick in that you cannot seal them as you would a typical poured concrete structure. Excellent sealers for low-porosity materials  such as a sodium silicate-based sealer  simply would not work effectively on concrete block. A sodium silicate sealer is comprised of similarly sized particles that seep into the concrete to protect the material, preventing such problems as the spread of mold and radon while helping proof the concrete from water seepage.Concrete blocks, however, are a much more porous material, featuring small holes and air bubbles of many different sizes. Therefore, a less uniform substance is needed for proper protection. A silane/siloxane-based sealer is a far better option for sealing concrete blocks  its blend of large and small particles, designed specifically for porous material, penetrate the surface and chemically react below the substrate to form a water-repellent barrier. As the barrier is actually below the surface, it cannot crack, peel, fade away, or yellow over time, ensuring that your brick looks beautiful regardless of actual age.If you are looking for the most advanced concrete sealer for concrete blocks that is environmentally friendly and easy to apply, Siloxa-Tek 8500 is by far the best option available on the market today. While chemical solvent-based sealers abound, they are increasingly becoming banned in states such as California, which require water-based sealers. Ghostshield has accordingly manufactured a water-based silane/siloxane-based sealer in the form of Siloxa-Tek 8500, abiding by EPA law while selling a product that provides excellent protection with a low VOC content. This water-based sealer helps protect from water seepage, mold and mildew, efflorescence, cracking, sun-damage, salt degradation, chemical exposure and more, all while being extremely easy to apply.

Best Concrete Countertop Sealer


						
							
							
								
								When you decide to install new countertops in your kitchen, there are a number of options. You could choose timeless butcherblock, chintzy laminate, or classy granite. However, one of the newer material options is the concrete countertop. Concrete is fast becoming a preferred material for constructing kitchen countertops, especially considering the health concerns associated with granite countertops emitting potentially cancer-causing radon.The benefits of concrete countertops, on the other hand, are many. For instance, it can be filled with colored materials or decorative particles such as quartz or marble, giving the concrete the look of a number of different stones, like granite, for a fraction of the cost. It is inexpensive and incredibly durable, lasting for long periods of time with little upkeep. They aren't easily damaged from knives or dropped pots and pans, and they can be protected from stains with a simple sealing regimen.Periodic sealing, maybe once every two years or so, will ensure your concrete countertops remain fresh and protected for the long haul. While the biggest threat to your concrete countertops would probably be acidic stains, like lemon juice, as well as other stains from tomato sauce or red wine. By choosing the proper sealer that will protect against heat, scratches, and other dangers, these stains will not seep into the concrete, instead sitting atop the material to be cleaned up at your leisure.Low Sheen Finish: The Concrete Countertop Sealer 660 is the perfect response to the many questions that abound regarding which type of concrete sealer to use. If you are looking for a low sheen finish on your concrete countertops the 660 is an excellent option especially since is completely non-toxic, water-based and safe for interaction with food. It will protect your concrete from UV degradation, stains and scratches that can plague countertops. The Concrete Countertop Sealer 660 is easy to apply, simply mix the concentrated solution with equal parts water and spread the solution over the countertop with a rag for five minutes. Continuously make sure the countertop is wet for the whole five minutes, then let the sealer dry into the concrete without wiping it up. After the surface has dried, apply another coat of a 3:1 ratio of sealer to water, which will help fully protect your countertops.Natural Finish: The Concrete Countertop Sealer 770 is also a non-toxic, water-based, food safe sealer that will not enhance the concrete or leave a sheen. If you are looking to keep the concrete countertops looking natural, or completely the same after sealing as they did prior to sealing the 770 is the product for you. The 770 is also able to withstand staining from household susbtances causing the fluids to sit ontop of the concrete rather than penetrating into the concrete giving you time to wipe up the mess. The Concrete Countertop Sealer 770 is easy to apply and is sold as a concentrated product. Simply mix the concentrated solution with 3 parts water and roll or brush the sealer over the countertop. Immediately apply a second coat while the first coat is still wet. After the surface has dried, your countertops will be fully protected.High Gloss Finish: The Polyaspartic 745 is typically used in commercial kitchens and bars since it is the most durable countertop sealer available. The Polyaspartic 745 can also be used on warehouse floors and is able to stand up to forklift traffic, chemicals and abrasions so using it on a concrete countertop is a no brainer.  The 745 can only be used on interior concrete countertops and leaves the surface with a high gloss finish. Since it is a coating rather than a sealer it sits on top of the concrete providing a smooth surface environment that allows for easy clean up and completely stops anything from penetrating through it. Before applying the 745 we recommend sanding the concrete countertop with a 220 grit pad to ensure the surface has enough porosity for the coating to adhere to. The Polyaspartic 745 is sold in a 2 part kit, so you need to mix Part A with Part B. It has a short workable life, which means once you mix Part A with Part B you have about 15 minutes to apply it before it begins to harden and is unworkable. You do need to let the countertop dry for at least a full 24 hours before use. Once cured you are left with an extremely durable, high gloss concrete countertop.

Industrial Floor Coatings


						
							
							
								
								Industrial floors, whether in factories or warehouses, require a high level of strength. Therefore, they are most commonly constructed from concrete, one of the strongest and most common manmade materials on the planet. However, a concrete floor is only as good as the sealer with which it is applied. The concrete sealer is just as important as the concrete floor itself, especially in settings such as industrial locations. Urethanes are one of the most common, and best, choices for industrial floors, as they feature incredible resistance to nearly any problem you could imagine.Aliphatic urethane is the type of urethane that is most commonly used as the topcoat for epoxy floor systems. There are two other types of urethane: aromatic and waterborne. Aliphatic, however, is a better choice for concrete sealing because it will not turn to the color amber when exposed to UV light (from the sun), like aromatic urethanes will. While waterborne urethanes also will not amber, they are not as strong as aliphatic, which offers excellent abrasion and chemical resistance, as well as strong color and gloss retention. Aliphatic urethanes, such as the Ghostshield Urethane 645, are most well known for offering UV stability and are highly resistant to severe chemicals and abrasions, due to their chemical composition. Their bonds are extremely strong, and they typically last for a long time.Before applying a urethane topcoat an epoxy base coat is used as a primer. Using an epoxy primer and urethane top coat is called an epoxy floor system, which is a series of products that are used on floors that feature heavy traffic, such as in airports, commercial retail stores, or industrial settings. They typically consist of a primary coat of a basic epoxy, designed to bond to the substrate on the surface, much like an acrylic surface sealer. Because the particles of material are larger than with penetrating sealers, the epoxy will not delve within the concrete, instead pooling on the surface to be spread out evenly during application.After this epoxy base coat of Epoxy 325, there usually is another coat of epoxy to help increase the durability of the concrete and its new coating system. After this coat, you can add paint chips or decorative quartz to add a little zest to your otherwise boring concrete surface. Once the paint chips and two other epoxy coats have dried, you are ready to add the urethane topcoat. An aliphatic urethane, while slightly more expensive than aromatic, is really the only choice of topcoat. Aromatic will yellow at the slightest sunlight and will also not last nearly as long, as it is not as strong of a bond.

Paver Sealer


						
							
							
								
								One of the most common forms of concrete used in warmer climates from Florida to California are pavers. While they may not be as strong as traditional concrete, pavers are, in fact, a type of concrete. This type of concrete is somewhat more delicate and prone to extreme damage in colder climates that suffer through harsh winters, which is why it isnt found as frequently in colder areas. Pavers are found in driveways, patios, pathways, walkways, pool decks, and other such areas in a wide variety of homes. They are inexpensive, aesthetically appealing, and fairly easy to maintain, all of which makes them a decidedly attractive option for installation.However, as pavers are typically made up of concrete, they can fall prey to a wide variety of potential problems that can harm their structural integrity and visual aesthetic charm. For instance, if you have pavers in your driveway, patio, or pool deck, excessive exposure to moisture and water can lead to degradation, corrosion, and cracking, all of which will likely result in costly repairs.Fortunately, there is an easy and cost-effective way to prevent these issues. Siloxa-Tek 8500, the best concrete paver sealer, will provide more than enough protection for your structure made out of pavers. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 is a water-based silane/siloxane sealer that is safe for personal application, environmentally friendly, and legal in all 50 states with low VOCs as compared to solvent-based sealers. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 will protect pavers from deicing salt damage and will never peel, flake or delaminate with UV exposure along with a variety of other benefits, such as increased slip-resistance, which can be a necessity if you have kids running around the pool deck.If you are looking for more of a satin finish or high gloss finish acrylic sealers, such as the Cryli-Tek 5500 or the Cryli-Tek 5505 are made up of large particles of sealant that cannot penetrate past the small surface pores of the concrete. Instead, the sealant will remain on the surface to be spread out evenly. These sealers will function like raincoats, keeping the water on the surface of the concrete rather than allowing it to penetrate past the surface. They also have the added benefit of resisting UV rays and the discoloration they wreak on your concrete, making youre your pavers remain bright and fresh. If you are looking for a satin finish the 5500 is a water based product that will give you a slight decorative sheen; whereas if you are looking for a gloss/wet look finish the 5505 is a solvent based product that will give a decorative enhancement.

Concrete Sealants


						
							
							
								
								All of the concrete in the world, regardless of the project or particular circumstances, is susceptible to environmental damage and gradual erosion due to the elements. Everyone has seen decrepit sidewalks cracked and spalled over time, allowing weeds to grow through, as well as slowly decaying bridge supports that are a major cause for concern in some areas of the country. There are an enormous number of other examples of decaying concrete, all of which emphasize the importance of taking the proper steps to seal and protect your concrete projects as soon as they are completed.The best, easiest, and most cost effective way to protect concrete is by sealing it with a high quality concrete sealer. However, how do you know which product to use on your particular project? The variety of sealers on the market is extensive, and it can often be confusing and daunting to wade through the many offerings.Penetrating Sealers:  If you are looking for the most comprehensive protection, a penetrating sealer is the way to go. Penetrating sealers have smaller particles of sealant that can penetrate past the miniscule surface pores, delving deep into the concrete. Waterproofing, impregnating, penetrating sealers such as silane/siloxanes are excellent choices for water repellency, deicing salt resistance and staining resistance.Product recommendations: Siloxa-Tek 8500, Siloxa-Tek 8505, Siloxa-Tek 8510Concrete Densifiers: Once in the concrete, the sealers will react with the various minerals already in the concrete, chemically strengthening and densifying the material. A by-product to this strengthening is the blocking up of pores and hairline cracks within the concrete, helping improve the concretes resistance to water damage. The better products on the market will even waterproof your concrete  most penetrating sealers are even permanent as well, providing life-long protection.Product recommendations: Lithi-Tek 9500, Lithi-Tek 4500, Sila-Tek 3500Decorative Sealers: To begin, if you have any sort of decorative concrete, such as a patio pool deck or a driveway made of pavers, and you want a decorative sheen you want to use an acrylic concrete sealer. Instead of penetrating into the material, an acrylic sealer will remain on the surface, with its large particles of sealant unable to penetrate past the tiny surface pores. Pooling on the surface for you to spread out during the application process, the acrylic sealer will eventually provide a comprehensive layer of protection, much like a raincoat, over the surface of your concrete.Product recommendations: Cryli-Tek 5505, Cryli-Tek 5500Industrial Coatings: Another option in concrete sealer is if you want to put in a decorative floor system. If you have a gray, plain concrete slab as a floor, such as in retail stores, warehouses, or industrial-type buildings, then you may want to increase the visual appeal of your space. The easiest way to do this while also protecting the concrete is to use an epoxy floor system. Epoxies are a type of concrete sealer that remain on the surface level. They are durable and high-resistance, making them perfect for places with high traffic and the potential for damage from abrasions and scratches. Simply apply the epoxy basecoats  add any sort of decorative aggregate you desire (such as quartz, sand, or paint chips), and finish it off with a urethane or polyaspartic topcoat. A urethane topcoat will be clear and will feature strong resistance to spills and abrasions. A polyaspartic is actually just another type of urethane coat, though it dries incredibly fast, making it a premier choice for those wishing to finish projects overnight.Product recommmendations: Epoxy 325, Urethane 645, Polyaspartic 745Concrete Countertop Sealers: Concrete countertops are a new trend and periodic sealing, maybe once every two years or so, will ensure your concrete countertops remain fresh and protected for the long haul. While the biggest threat to your concrete countertops would probably be acidic stains, like lemon juice, as well as other stains from tomato sauce or red wine. By choosing the proper sealer that will protect against heat, scratches, and other dangers, these stains will not seep into the concrete, instead sitting atop the material to be cleaned up at your leisure.

How to Prevent Concrete Floor Dusting


						
							
								The easiest way to deal with concrete dusting is to cure your concrete properly. If your concrete has already cured and you are experiencing dusting use a concrete coating to stop concrete floor dusting. 
							
								
								Concrete dusting is usually a chalky white or gray dust coloring over the natural gray of concrete, leading to an unpleasant visual facade for your concrete. Concrete dusting is an awfully unattractive and unappealing situation that can plague concrete floors. While it is not an indicator of failing structural strength or or compromised structural integrity, concrete dusting can be a nuisance.Concrete is created through a process that involves mixing together water, Portland cement, and some sort of aggregate, such as sand or gravel. Once these materials are mixed together properly, they can be poured and cured to result in strong concrete.Concrete dusting is, unfortunately, a natural by-product of the concrete mixing process when the curing process has not been properly completed. Curing concrete is incredibly important to its structural integrity: improperly cured concrete will never reach the full potential for its strength, and it will always also have problems.The easiest way to deal with concrete dusting is to cure your concrete properly.Unfortunately, you likely are not actually overseeing the curing process; its even likely that youre living in a home whose concrete has been poured and cured long ago. Fortunately, there is still an easy and cost-effective way to help reduce and remove concrete dusting without repouring and recuring the concrete, which can be incredibly expensive and tiresome.Concrete coatings are a great option for the homeowner, contractor, or other concrete owner faced with concrete dusting.

How to Diamond Grind Concrete


						
							
							
								
								If you moved into a home, or perhaps purchased a building to serve as a new location for your business, you have no control over how the previous occupant(s) preserved the concrete. Concrete, while incredibly durable and long lasting, can crumble and degrade long before it is supposed to. The many steps of the concrete mixing, curing, and pouring process offer opportunities for mistakes that can leave the concrete vulnerable to gradual wear. Similarly, once the concrete is poured and cured properly, it still needs to be treated with a high quality concrete sealer before it can reach its maximum potential strength and longevity.However, as you cannot often control these circumstances, it is important to find ways to fix blemished and degraded concrete after the fact. While concrete that is too far gone is extremely expensive to fix, there remain options if you catch the degradation early enough. There are a number of options that work for various types of concrete problems: polishing, sealing, acid etching, etc. One of the best options for a concrete surface marred with a variety of surface imperfections, diamond grinding is the best way to effectively fix the concrete without spending too much money.Diamond grinding concrete is a relatively straightforward process that will require the renting of equipment. As concrete is an extremely strong material, one of the only ways to smoothly grind away a blemished surface is to use the strongest material found on earth: diamond. Diamond grinders can be rented at most hardware stores, and the process itself is easy enough: just follow the instructions that come with your particular machine and evenly run over the surface of the blemished concrete with the grinder.The end result will be a concrete surface etched with tiny lines. These lines will not only help your concrete surface become level and blemish-free, but they will also significantly help increase the slip resistance of your concrete. And, while diamond grinding isnt necessarily difficult, it is not something you want to do every year. Fortunately, diamond grinding will last around sixteen to seventeen years before it needs to be redone.

Best Concrete Sealer for a Fireplace


						
							
							
								
								Concrete is not a flammable material. While it may not be entirely immune to fire and fire damage, it is not as likely to catch fire as a wooden structure. The lack of flammability is one of concretes biggest pluses, and it is also the reason many fireplaces are made out of brick. Brick is a type of concrete, albeit slightly more delicate and significantly more porous. The imperviousness to flame makes brick an attractive choice for someone looking to build and install a fireplace, whether indoor or outdoor. Concrete fireplaces are becoming more popular and it is an excellent idea to seal them before use.Fireplaces are wonderful areas for gathering around as a family or as a group of friends, as fires provide the communal sense of trust, comfort, and relaxation that helps provide a pleasing aesthetic and physical atmosphere for an evening of bonding. Concrete and brick have long been the preferred material used to construct fireplaces; while these two materials are well known for their strength, durability, and longevity, they need a little help to reach their maximum potential. However, the one step homeowners commonly forget to take is that of sealing their fireplaces. Fireplaces, either indoor or outdoor, often are exposed to myriad sources of wear that can degrade and corrupt its visual and structural integrity.If your fireplace is made out of a material like brick or concrete, you will want to treat it with a water-based silane/siloxane sealer like Siloxa-Tek 8500. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 will protect the surface of your fireplace protecting it from mold, mildew, efflorscence and water damage. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 also features excellent UV stability, helping to ensure your fireplace does not become discolored due to sun exposure or too much soot and smoke. For any type of fireplace, you need to be certain to use a water-based sealer. The use of a solvent-based sealer will lead to potentially harmful health side effects, as the VOCs within the solvent-based sealers are released when exposed to low heat. You do not want your family and friends sitting around the fire breathing in potentially harmful chemicals. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 is a great water-based product that offers comprehensive protection without the harmful side effects caused by VOCs.

Best Concrete Sealer for Exposed Aggregate


						
							
							
								
								While concrete is well known to be incredibly strong, exposed aggregate is significantly weaker. Aggregate is an ingredient in the mixing process that creates concrete, and is typically sand, gravel, or crushed up rocks. This aggregate is then combined with water and Portland cement, which results in concrete after the substance has been mixed, poured, and dried. Once mixed, the concrete can experience years of wear and tear without losing any of its noted strength. However, concrete has the potential to deteriorate and degrade in a far shorter period of time, especially if exposed to extreme elements or excessive human traffic (via machinery, vehicles, and the like).Various potentials problems and pitfalls threaten exposed concrete aggregate. Water damage and an excess of salt seeping into the concrete are two of the most potent threats, especially during the winter. Concrete naturally is dotted with tiny holes that lead to an extensive network of microscopic pores and hairline cracks; if water seeps into the exposed aggregate during the Spring, Summer, and Fall when the weather is warmer, that water will become stuck in the concrete, clogged in the aforementioned vast network. While water poses a significant threat to concrete during the warmer months, this potential damage pales in comparison to what can afflict it in the winter. The freeze/thaw cycle is one of the most dangerous occurrences that can happen to concrete: when the water seeps into the concrete in the warmer months, it will remain there until it freezes in the winter, expanding and cracking the concrete in the process. Then, when the ice melts come Spring, the concrete will contract, cracking and crumbling even further. This situation can lead to costly and time-consuming headaches for home and business owners alike.Another potential problem comes with too much salt seeping into the exposed aggregate during the winter, especially in places that feature salt trucks to help make icy roads safer. Too much salt seeping into the exposed aggregate can lead to tremendous structural problems. Fortunately, there is an easy preventative measure you can take. Simply apply a concrete sealer, like the Siloxa-Tek 8500, to the exposed aggregate. The Siloxa-Tek 8500, a water-based silane/siloxane, will act as a salt barrier, penetrating into the concrete substrate in order to provide comprehensive protection from water, UV radiation, cracking, spalling and pitting.

Driveway Sealer


						
							
							
								
								If your home features a driveway made from concrete, you need to seal the slab early on to avoid potentially costly, disastrous, and unfixable problems in the future. Many driveways are made from asphalt, which means the use of a concrete sealer is not the appropriate choice. However, more driveways are made from concrete  whether a traditional gray slab or another variant of concrete, such as pavers  which makes a concrete sealer imperative.Concrete sealers help protect concrete slabs from a variety of dangers. Concrete, while extremely strong, is also very porous. The high level of porosity is due to its mixing process: water, Portland cement, and some sort of aggregate, such as sand or gravel, are diligently mixed together to form what will become concrete. Then, the mixture is properly poured and cured until it fully dries to its full strength. However, a natural by-product of this process is the creation of a large number of microscopic pores and hairline cracks that extend throughout the slab.These pores and cracks do not normally threaten a concrete slabs structural integrity. However, the weather, human error, and the elements  those ever-present and unavoidable threats  can reduce your seemingly strong and solid concrete slab to a crumbling disaster. This is especially true for a concrete driveway which is constantly exposed to the elements with nary a break. And if your driveway is in an area that sees snow and ice in the winter, such potential threats as freeze/thaw cycles and excess salt from salted roads can ruin your concrete faster than you would believe.The best choice for a concrete driveway would be the Siloxa-Tek 8500, Siloxa-Tek 8505 or Siloxa-Tek 8510. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 is a water based water and salt repellent, the Siloxa-Tek 8505 is a water based water, salt and stain repellent and the Siloxa-Tek 8510 is a solvent based water, salt and stain repellent. All three products will protect concrete driveways from spalling, pitting, cracking, corrosion and degradation.

Water Repellents for Driveways


						
							
							
								
								Driveways can be one of the most problematic areas of your home, in terms of the time and monetary cost of maintenance over the years. Driveways made out of concrete often crack, crumble, and degrade in various ways over the course of its life. This holds especially true if the driveway is located in a place that experiences harsh winters. The elements are one of the biggest threat to concretes integrity, and winter weather can be the most disastrous to a concrete slabs longevity.While damage from salt and overexposure to other minerals can irreparably harm your concrete, freeze/thaw cycles are probably the biggest potential source of damage a concrete surface can face. In the warmer months water seeps into the concrete, becoming lodged in the extensive network of pores and hairline cracks that are natural to all concrete. Once within the material, the water often cannot escape, sitting there indefinitely. While this can be a minor problem in warmer climates, it can be ruinous with the onset of winter. As the temperature drops, the water within the concrete freezes, leading to expansion. The expansion causes the concrete to crack, which is only further exacerbated and made worse when the ice melts and the concrete contracts once again. These cracks are significant sources of future damage, as corrosion and further cracking now easily occur.In order to protect your concrete from the dreaded freeze/thaw cycle, you need to apply a product during the warmer months, preferably as soon as you can. For a concrete driveway, you'll want to choose one of the following products:Siloxa-Tek 8500: A water based, water and deicing salt repellent sealer. Great for protecting concrete driveways from freeze-thaw cycles, cracking, spalling and pitting. Longevity: 5-10 years.Siloxa-Tek 8505: A water based, water, deicing salt and stain repellent sealer. Great for protecting concrete driveways from freeze-thaw cycles, cracking, spalling, pitting and staining from oils, grease and leaves. Longevity: 5-10 years.Siloxa-Tek 8510: The best concrete driveway sealer available, a solvent based, water, deicing salt and stain repellent sealer. Great for protecting concrete driveways from freeze-thaw cycles, cracking, spalling, pitting and staining from oils, grease and leaves. Longevity: 8-10 years.Lithi-Tek 9500: A great option for driveways not exposed to deicing salts, to prevent water, mold, mildew and organic growth. Longevity: 5-10 years.Cryli-Tek 5505: A solvent based acrylic sealer that enhances, protects, and provides a clear, high-gloss finish. Longevity: 1-3 years.

Best Concrete Sealer for a Highway


						
							
							
								
								Being the most widely-traveled and well worn method of transportation around and across the United States, highways require an increased level of care and protection. Public transportation may be favored in cities, but roads and highways are still vital to the American system of transportation. Similarly, while trains and airplanes provide alternatives to driving between cities, they are often expensive or inconvenient for any number of reasons, causing many Americans to have to take to the roads and vast highway system of the United States.However, in order for highways to remain as strong and reliable as possible, they need to be well maintained to stand the test of time and the ravages of the elements. For starters, we must ask how does one care for concrete? The best answer to that question is to use a quality concrete sealing product to help protect the highways from the elements, especially constant exposure to the sun, rain, snow, sleet, hail, and ice. As probably the biggest threat to all man-made constructions and creations, weather is an ever present part of life that never goes away, especially for such things as roads and highways that are constantly exposed to the elements.Therefore, highways certainly need to be protected with a high quality concrete sealer. Once this is accepted, the next question becomes which concrete sealer to use. Concrete sealers come in a wide variety of kinds, each suited to a specific and particular type of project. For a concrete highway, the proper choice would be a silane/siloxane concrete sealer. Silane/siloxane concrete sealers, like the Siloxa-Tek 8510, contain particles of silane and particles of siloxane, which are two different things. The silane particles will penetrate slightly past the surface of the concrete while the siloxane particles will pool on the surface of the concrete to be spread out over the course of the application process. Together, the two types of particles suspeneded in the Siloxa-Tek's solvent-based solution will work in concert to create a hydrophobic barrier that locks out excessive water, as well as other minerals (like salts from trucks in the winter) and staining from oils and greases, from entering the concrete where they can wreak havoc, resulting in potentially costly repairs.

Why Seal a Warehouse with Aliphatic Urethane


						
							
							
								
								Warehouses are important to the well oiled functioning of any company that sells goods. Without a place to store their goods, companies would not be able to generate profit. Of course, while the storage space has to be uniquely suited to the goods of each particular company, most warehouses are constructed from concrete, which offers the most durable and strong structure in which goods can be storedConcrete on its own, however, is not enough. Concrete has a number of tiny microscopic pores and hairlines cracks that extend throughout the material in a vast network that connects the two sides of the concrete slab together. These pores and cracks are natural by-products of concretes composition, as it is made from the mixing of an aggregate, like sand, with water and Portland cement. The presence of the pores can lead to a variety of potential damages that can ruin the structural integrity of the concrete that is protecting whatever you may have in your warehouse.Warehouse floors are often the most important part of any warehouse, as well as being the most likely places to suffer damage. The floors of warehouses are frequently trodden by steel-toe work boots and the tires of trucks, forklifts, and other heavy machinery. Similarly, if the products are heavy enough, they can fall onto the concrete, cracking it and causing scratches that can weaken the concretes strength and impair its longevity.The best concrete sealer for a warehouse would be an aliphatic urethane. Aliphatic urethanes are topical level sealers that feature an incredibly strong bond to the surface of the concrete substrate. Once bonded, they last for an exceptionally long time. Aliphatic urethanes, like the Urethane 645, offer extensive protection from extreme damages, such as excessive heat, abrasions, cracking, water incursion, UV radiation, as well as a variety of other potential harms. When you apply the Urethane 645 to your warehouse floor, you can rest assured that the concrete beneath it will remain unharmed for a long time.

Best Concrete Sealer for an Aircraft Hangar


						
							
							
								
								Aircraft hangars are one of the oft-overlooked aspects of concrete sealing and protection. As few people own aircraft hangars independently, the instructions and proper steps to take to care for these structures often fall by the wayside, leaving the owner and/or builder of the aircraft hangar unable to find information on how to protect his/her investment. Fortunately, the process is fairly straightforward  even easy and cost-effective  for the average consumer and for the experienced professional.Aircraft hangars tend to be massive structures made large enough to house some amount of airplanes. Whether jumbo jets or private aircraft, these structures need to be big enough to protect the vehicles from weather damage and threats from the elements. The planes are important investments that can cost millions of dollars  you wouldnt want any damage marring your craft, or the craft of anyone else, when such damage is so easily avoidable. Just as you want to protect the aircraft, shouldnt the hangar itself be protected from the elements as well?The steps to ensure this level of protection are fairly easy. First, you need to use a product like the Epoxy 325 as a priming coat that acts as a base layer. The Epoxy 325 is a product that will feature a strong bond and level of adhesion to the concrete substrate of the aircraft hangar. This strong bond will last for a significant amount of time, often for over a decade, offering such benefits as water resistance, abrasion resistance, and UV resistance from the suns powerful rays. The Epoxy 325 should be applied to the hangars floor to help ensure the concrete does not crack and degrade under the weight and traffic from airplanes. These vehicles are incredibly heavy, which makes the concrete under them liable to crack and corrode. The Epoxy 325 base layer is the first step to ensuring adequate protection.Next, you need to apply either another layer of Epoxy 325, depending on the level of traffic and risk of cracking your hangar has. Finally, you should apply a topcoat of the Urethane 645, which will provide comprehensive and thorough surface-level protection, bonding to the epoxy base layer(s) to enhance the concrete sealing shield. The Urethane 645 is a product that offers some of the most comprehensive protection possible in any type of concrete sealer. It is a clear topcoat that will protect against extreme levels of water exposure, abrasions, chemical spills, UV radiation, heat exposure, and so on. The Urethane 645s protection is complemented by the Epoxy 325, which makes the High Build Epoxy System found on GHOSTSHIELDs website the right choice for any airplane hangar with a high level of traffic and potential damage.

How to Mitigate Radon


						
							
							
								
								Radon radiation is fast becoming recognized as a dangerous, silent killer seeping into our homes, responsible for somewhere around 21,000 deaths per year due to lung cancer, according to federal agencies. (Radon can cause lung cancer in certain individuals.) Concrete, unfortunately, does not stop the passage of radon into your home. In fact, the small pores and networks of hairline cracks actually allow radon to pass through unstopped.Radon itself is an odorless, tasteless, and visually invisible gas, which means you really cannot know if your home is inflicted with radon without getting radon test kits. If you think your home might be at risk, you should purchase some test kits before choosing to take the necessary steps to protect your home. However, you can also take certain steps to protect your home from radon that will also help protect your concrete generally, from cracking, degradation, and the elements.The best concrete sealers to use to combat radon, specifically, are products like the Sila-Tek 3500 or the Lithi-Tek 4500. Both of these products are water-based silicate penetrating sealers, designed to penetrate past the surface of the concrete. Once within the concrete, they will both react chemically with the minerals already present in the material to block up the network of pores and hairline cracks through which gases like radon can travel. Once these microscopic passages are blocked up, the radon will not be able to seep into your home.These two sealers also offer the added benefit of strengthening your concrete itself. As part of the chemical reaction, the silicate particles present in both sealers react to form more calcium silicate hydrate, or CSH, which is the material that gives concrete all of its legendary strength and durability. With the application of the Sila-Tek 3500 or the Lithi-Tek 4500, the concrete will not only be stronger, but it will protect your house by sealing out radon once and for all.

Best Concrete Sealer for Pavers


						
							
							
								
								If you live in a place in a warmer climate, such as Florida, then you likely have some sort of structure made up of pavers. Pavers are a ubiquitous material found throughout places like California and Florida, making up driveways, patios, and pool decks in a wide variety of homes. They are inexpensive, aesthetically appealing, and fairly easy to maintain, all of which makes them a decidedly attractive option for installation. However, as pavers are typically made up of concrete, they are susceptible to a myriad of problems that can weaken their structurally integrity and visual appeal over time. For instance, if you have pavers in your driveway, patio, or pool deck, too much exposure to water and moisture can cause them to degrade, corrode, and crack, which can lead to costly repairs. Fortunately, there is an easy and cost-effective way to prevent these issues. A concrete sealer, such as the Siloxa-Tek 8500  will provide ample protection for your pavers. It leaves a natural finish and provides the longest lasting protection with a guarantee to never peel, flake or delaminate. It is also able to hold up to deicing salt damage, and freeze-thaw cycles unlike acrylic based products. On the other hand if you are looking to enhance the look, feel and texture of the pavers the best sealer to use is the Cryli-Tek 5500 (water based, low sheen) or Cryli-Tek 5505 (solvent based, gloss/wet look). While solvent-based sealers tend to last longer, the water-based variety are safer for personal application, environmentally friendly, and legal in most places with their low VOC contents. The Cryli-Tek 5500 is the water-based offering that functions just as well as the solvent-based cousin it features excellent longevity, comprehensive protection, and a variety of other benefits, such as increased slip-resistance, which can be a necessity if you have kids running around the pool deck. Acrylic sealers feature large particles of sealant that cannot penetrate past the small surface pores of the concrete. Instead, the sealant will remain on the surface to be spread out evenly. These sealers will function like raincoats, keeping the water on the surface of the concrete rather than allowing it to penetrate past the surface. They also have the great side benefit of resisting UV rays and discoloration, making sure the aesthetic appeal of your pavers remain as bright and vibrant as when they were installed.

Best Concrete Sealer For a Chimney


						
							
							
								
								Chimneys are typically made of brick, especially in a region like New England with all of its classic colonials constructed throughout its long history. However, if you live in any other area with colder climates, the brick chimney is likely a ubiquitous fixture in your home as well as the abodes of your neighbors. These chimneys will offer an excellent source of heating and warmth, all while providing countless aesthetic and homely charms.However, the brick of your chimney is at-risk of deterioration and degradation over the years, especially in areas that suffer through harsher winters. Winters bring with them the threat of salts, melting water, blustery winds, and the absolutely terrifyingly disastrous freeze/thaw cycles. The freeze/thaw cycles are particularly devastating to concrete, and especially more delicate concrete like brick. When water gets into the concrete in the warmer months, it will sit there until it freezes in the winter. Once it freezes, it will thaw with the advent of spring, which can lead to disastrous cracking and crumbling that can ruin both the visual aesthetic of your chimney, as well as its structural integrity.The easiest way to deal with freeze/thaw cycles and the other dangers of winter is to apply a concrete sealer to your chimney. Concrete sealers are substances that help reinforce your concrete and enhance its longevity and performance. For a chimney made up of bricks or another more porous concrete material, a silane/siloxane sealer like Siloxa-Tek 8500 is your best choice. Silane/siloxane sealers are made up of large particles of sealant that will not penetrate past the surface, as well as a small quantity of smaller particles of sealant that will penetrate, though only to a certain depth. The larger particles of sealant are ideal for the porous brick, as they will pool on the surface to be spread out evenly over the concretes exterior, while the smaller particles will resist the incursion of water even further. The sealer will act as a raincoat, keeping out water and salt that can penetrate within the concrete to cause incomprehensible damage. If you have a chimney attached to your home, take the necessary steps to prevent damage before it occurs. Treat your brick with a silane/siloxane sealer, and rest assured that your chimney will last a very long time.

How to Reduce Hydrostatic Pressure


						
							
							
								
								One of the greatest fears any home or building owner has, likely, on a daily basis, is a fear of a flooded home. Not only would the costs and headaches to clean up the water be tremendous, the realization that you have lost or had ruined most of your physical possessions in the affected areas would be absolutely crushing. Nobody likes flooding, and it only makes sense to take all of the necessary and possible steps to prevent it.However, if you live near a body of water, you may be out of luck, at the very least the odds are certainly not in your favor. The ground near lakes, rivers, ponds, oceans, and such bodies of water tend to have high water tables. This means that the amount of water already in the soil is higher than it would be in an area not near a body of water. The more water already present beneath the surface of the ground means that, when it rains or when the snow melts, less water can sink through the earth. Instead, that water remains on the surface, which leads to massive flooding.This is known as hydrostatic pressure: when there is too much water in the ground for more water to be absorbed. The resulting pressure is what propels the surface water aboveground, leading it directly into your homes, depending on where you live and how well you have reduced hydrostatic pressure. The hydrostatic pressure is directly linked to the pressure of the water against your concrete basement walls, floors, and foundations. In order to both protect your home from water, as well as to relieve some of this hydrostatic pressure, you need to apply a concrete sealer to your vulnerable concrete.In order to reduce the amount of hydrostatic pressure from entering a home it is best to use a densifying primer such as the Lithi-Tek 4500, followed up 7 days later by two coats of the Siloxa-Tek 8500 applied wet-on-wet. All of these sealers should be applied to dry concrete before the threat of any flooding. They will help lock out water from the concrete, all while helping reduce hydrostatic pressure, further making flooding in your home more difficult and more unlikely.

Best Sealer for a High-Rise Building


						
							
							
								
								One of the most incredible modern marvels of building and construction has to be the skyscraper. Soaring into the sky from the ground, thrust into the clouds to stand majestic in the skyline among the lesser, squat buildings, skyscrapers have revolutionized urban planning and how we used space. High-rise buildings, a designation that includes skyscrapers as well as their less vertically-gifted cousins, are just as ubiquitous and common in any city. Their importance to the continued growth and effectiveness of cities cannot be overstated.However, high-rise buildings also pose more danger than would a smaller structure. Towering as high as they do, these structures are at risk of collapse if they are made improperly, or if there are imperfections in the concrete. Concrete, while an incredibly stable and strong material, can nonetheless be plagued by a variety of issues over time. Its method of mixture leaves a large number of pores and hairline cracks within the material. This network of cracks and pores allows for the passage of water into the material. If the buildings are built in a colder climate, this water can freeze in the winter and thaw in the summer, leading to large cracks. Even if the concrete is located in a warmer climate, there are still numerous opportunities for cracks, crumbling, and damage.On a smaller building, this type of damage would potentially be negligible, unimportant to the daily functioning of the structure. However, on a high-rise building, such damage can be disastrous. Even the potential for damage can ruin a companys reputation and lead to the building being condemned.Fortunately there is a cost-effective way to protect the concrete featured in high-rise buildings. After the concrete has been mixed, poured, and cured, it should be treated with a high-quality concrete sealer, which will help it retain its strength and longevity as well as resist carboniation, salt damage and corrosion. A sealer like the Iso-Tek 8501 will provide penetrating protection. The particles of sealant penetrate into the concrete and since the product is thixotropic it will not run or sag down the concrete. This gives the concrete enough time to absorp the sealer and achieve a targeted consumption depth. The Iso-Tek 8501 has been used on the tallest residential building in the western hemisphere and is a great choice for high-rise buildings.

How to Grind Concrete 


						
							
							
								
								If you have concrete, you probably know the importance of treating your concrete surfaces with a strong concrete sealer. These products can ensure your concrete remains as strong as it was when it was first poured for lifetimes. Additionally, they can even make your concrete stronger and better prepared to stand up to tough environmental conditions. If you choose to apply concrete sealer, however, you have to know the proper precautions to take to ensure your safety. Equally important is making sure the proper conditions are met to ensure that the concrete sealer is able to bond with or penetrate into the concrete. Without proper adhesion or penetration, the concrete sealer will not be protecting your concrete, leaving it vulnerable to the same problems as untreated concrete.Grinding concrete, however, is not something you can just do. In order to properly grind concrete, you have to treat it with a densifer. A product like the Lithi-Tek 4500  will penetrate within the concrete, making it significantly stronger by reacting to fill the concrete with more of the naturally occurring material that gives concrete its strength. Once the concrete has been densified, you can feel free to grind it according to the proper methods using a grinding disk. And, finally, once the concrete has been ground and is at a CSP level 2 or 3, you can feel free to apply an industrial grade coating like the Epoxy 325, Urethane 645 or Polyaspartic 745.

How to Seal Decorative Concrete Overlays


						
							
							
								
								One of the biggest drawbacks to concrete is its natural visual appearance. Once concrete has been poured and cured, the surface is rough, marked by pores and holes covering an expanse of light gray. While the structural qualities of concrete make it an unbeatable material to be used in construction, its benefits are more in the functional realm. That has not stopped the evolution of methods to enhance the visual appeal of concrete, such as decorative concrete floor systems and concrete dye stains.In the pursuit of foolproof ways to decorate your otherwise drab concrete surfaces, decorative concrete overlays are one of the newer methods devised by the industry to increase the visual appeal of your concrete surfaces. Not only do decorative concrete overlays improve the aesthetics of your concrete, but they also actually help structurally to cover up surface imperfections, helping to seal cracks and other potential problems before they spiral out of control.Decorative concrete overlays are systems that blend polymer resins with additives, such as cement and sand, which increase the durability and performance of concrete while enhancing the visual appeal. Once applied to your concrete surfaces, these decorative overlays immediately enhance the visual nature of the concrete, making whatever surface to which it is applied seem that much better. With a wide variety of color schemes and textures, concrete overlays can be adapted to suit any number of surfaces and environments.Of course, the best benefit to a concrete overlay is that it does not impair the structural integrity of your concrete. Concrete overlays actually improve the structure of the concrete by sealing up pesky cracks and hairline fractures in the concrete, all while ensuring that these problems do not get worse. In order to retain their level of effectiveness, however, you must seal the concrete overlay with a quality concrete sealer. A concrete sealer, when applied to an overlay, will improve the already impressive strength of the concrete and its new visual addition. Without a concrete sealer, such as the Cryli-Tek 5500 or Cryli-Tek 5505, the concrete overlay features the same risks as does normal concrete untreated with concrete: eventual cracking, water damage, and UV degradation. While a concrete overlay offers protection for your concrete, dont forget to protect that overly itself, ensuring long-lasting protection.

How to Seal Concrete Before Installing Carpet


						
							
								If you want to install carpet over your concrete floors, it is important that you properly seal the concrete slab. Without using a concrete sealer before installing carpet the concrete could potentially let in water that could lead to mold, mildew or water seepage.

							
								
								In order to determine what concrete sealer to use it is best to perform a calcium chloride test to determine the moisture vapor emission rate (MVER) of a concrete slab. If a high amount of moisture is present in the concrete (over 3 lb according to a calcium chloride test) it is best to use a moisture vapor barrier coating. Carpet manufacturers recommend the moisture vapor emission rate not exceed a 3 lb or 5 lb level before installing carpet. Benefits include the protection of carpet, wood, vinyl and other flooring by reducing the effects of moisture vapor transmission of up to 20 lb / 24 hr / 1,000 ft. A properly sealed concrete floor will ensure the carpet remains dry and in optimal condition, at least from below.
								Why Ghostshield?
								Use the VAPOR-TEK 440 to reduce moisture vapor transmission to levels that are acceptable for the installation of carpet. The high performance and quick installation features of this system make it an ideal solution to seal concrete from all water and moisture before installing carpet. The Vapor-Tek 440 will reduce moisture vapor emission rates of up to 20lb. / 24 hr / 1,000 ft. prior to the application of flooring.If your concrete has never had a moisture or dampness problem and you are looking for a cost-effective solution, use the LITHI-TEK 4500 primer followed up seven days later by the SILOXA-TEK 8510 concrete sealer. The combination of the two products will reduce the porosity of the concrete making it less permeable to moisture.

How to Seal Concrete with Moisture 


						
							
							
								
								What do you do when faced with one of the worst tragedies that can befall a home? Water damage in a basement or even in the home itself can be one of the most devastating disasters. Not only is your sense of security lost, but your house will have structural damage, a bad smell, and many of possessions will likely be ruined. The best way to prevent such damage is to seal your concrete properly with an appropriate concrete sealer as soon as the concrete has finished curing. This will help limit the passage of water through the concrete, as well as densifying the material so it will not crack (which is the leading cause for leakages). However, if you have not sealed your concrete but you now are faced with water damage, there is still hope. All you need to do is follow the following steps in order to clean up the damage to your concrete and seal it properly to ensure that any future damage does not occur. First, you must use a dry vacuum to remove all of the standing water. If the water incursion happens in your basement, for example, there is likely a large amount of standing water just sitting down there. That water cannot recede back through the concrete whence it came, so it instead will just sit down there until you are able to dry vac it out. Once this process is completed, you can begin the next step of sealing all the cracks with a hydrophobic crack repair kit. A hydrophobic crack repair kit will resist water, able to be applied to a damp concrete surface as non-hydrophobic crack fillers would not. The crack filler will repair any cracks in the concrete through which the water passed.The concrete needs to be as dry as possible prior to sealing. If you think of concrete as a sponge it needs to be as dry as possible in order to absorp as much sealer as possible. Now that the water has been cleaned up and the cracks repaired, youre ready to properly seal the concrete. If you are sealing a surface that is primarily the more porous concrete blocks, you should choose the Siloxa-Tek 8500. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 will penetrate within the blocks while also providing a layer of surface protection, designed as it is to work with more porous material. The Lithi-Tek 4500 primer and Siloxa-Tek 8500 topcoat, on the other hand, is an excellent combination that should only be used on poured concrete. The Lithi-Tek 4500 will penetrate within the concrete to react chemically, densifying the material and helping prevent any future cracks and subsequent disasters, while the Siloxa-Tek 8500 will provide a hydrophobic surface environment.

Best Sealer for Polished Concrete


						
							
							
								
								Concrete, while strong and a great choice for many building and aesthetic projects, can often be drab and gray, lacking any visual appeal. While this is not a problem for, say, a basement, if you own a business that features concrete, you probably want it to look more presentable. There are a number of ways to enhance concretes visual aesthetic, such as decorative floor systems, paint chips and surface sealers, and so on. But if you want to improve the concrete without changing the color, a popular choice is attempting to make your concrete shiny.Shiny concrete typically retains the visual appeal without sacrificing any of its structural integrity. If you use a quality concrete sealer, it will also remain as slip-resistant as untreated concrete. The shine of a properly sealed concrete slab can make the otherwise boring exterior seem like a more welcoming, sleek, and successful facade.The process to seal concrete so that it results in an exterior shine is not all that difficult either. First, you need to seal the concrete slab with a densifer, such as Lithi-Tek 4500. This product will penetrate within the concrete to react chemically beneath the surface. These chemical reactions will lead to the production of more calcium silicate hydrate, a mineral already present within the concrete naturally. The addition of more calcium silicate hydrate will help fill in the various cracks and pores that are natural to concrete, by-products of its creation. The extra CSH will densify the material, making it stronger and more resistant to such dangers as water damage and cracking.It is necessary to seal the concrete with the Lithi-Tek 4500 because the next step will render that impossible. Once the slab is properly sealed and has dried, you will need to polish the concrete. This is a relatively straightforward process that basically means the surface of the concrete will be shaved to rid it of its imperfections. The result will be a perfectly flat, polished, and shiny exterior that is already protected from danger due to the application of the densifer, enhancing the visual appeal of any concrete surface.

How to Seal Concrete Countertops


						
							
							
								
								Anyone who has ever cooked knows the importance of a quality kitchen. There are a few different elements to one  space, appliances, cabinets  but the most important aspect of any good kitchen is its countertops. Without high quality countertops that resist heat, stain, and other such common cooking threats, a kitchen just is not complete.Concrete countertops are fast becoming the preferred material for kitchen countertops as many homeowners choose the material over traditional granite. Granite has been shown to occasionally emit harmful gases and substances that can potentially lead to lifelong complications. Despite these concerns, it is largely safe and still widely used. However, granite countertops are being rejected more and more for concrete countertops.Concrete countertops not only look good, but they are also highly functional. They resist abrasion, staining, and high heat, among many other such dangers. They are also less expensive than pricey granite, which makes it an extremely attractive choice for homeowners. However, a concrete countertop is only as good as the concrete sealer used to protect it.Countertop Sealer 660: If you are looking for a low sheen finish use the Countertop Sealer 660.Countertop Sealer 770: If you are looking for a natural finish use the Countertop Sealer 770.Polyaspartic 745: If you are looking for a high gloss finish use the Polyaspartic 745.

5 Ways to Prepare Your Home for Winter


						
							
							
								
								By the time fall rolls around, most of us are ready to say goodbye to the summer heat, and hello to a few months of cool weather. However, autumn is more than just a time to enjoy the changing color of the leaves and the dropping of the mercury in the thermometer; its a time to prepare your home for the coming ravages of winter. After all, if you dont take care of potential problems now, before they actually happen, you could find yourself stuck with some major repair work right in the middle of the Holiday Season. Heres a quick list of things you need to do to prepare your home for the coldest months of the year.Fix basement cracks: Unsightly basement cracks may just seem like a visual nuisance but in actually they are the leading cause of water and moisture problems in basements. Scope out all cracks and fill them with a crack filler to prevent water from intrudingSeal your basement to prevent spring water damage: By using either a silane/siloxane sealer Siloxa-Tek 8500 on concrete blocks or cinderblock and Lithi-Tek 9500 on poured foundations your basement will be sealed and protected from water as a result of spring melt-age. Or even moisture from winter snow.Fix driveway cracks: Driveways are especially susceptible to cracking and spalling after a winter of snow and ice. By fixing all existing cracks before winter you reduce the risk of expansion and extensive damage.Seal your driveway to prevent salt degredation, spalling and freeze-thaw damage: Salt is one of the most destructive forces to a concrete driveway. By protecting the driveway with Siloxa-Tek 8500, spalling, salt degradation and freeze-thaw damage are all prevented.Seal your sidewalks to prevent salt degredation, spalling and freeze-thaw damage: Salt is one of the most destructive forces to a concrete sidewalk. By protecting the sidewalk with Siloxa-Tek 8500, spalling, salt degradation and freeze-thaw damage are all prevented.

Best Sealer for an Industrial Warehouse


						
							
							
								
								The functionality of a commercial, industrial warehouse can vary from storage, manufacturing, retail or machinery operations. With the wide variety of possibilities how do we recommend a sealer for this type of application? Warehouse, though multifaceted, all have a large square footage and practicality of application in common. There are a few options when it comes to sealing an industrial warehouse, you can use a concrete densifier to polish the concrete, you can use a penetrating oil repellent sealer, or you can use a concrete coating such as an epoxy and urethane. If you are looking to polish the concrete the best product to use is the Lithi-Tek 4500  Concrete densifiers like the 4500 will strengthen the concrete creating a harder, stronger more durable and abrasion resistant surface. Densifiers sink into the open pores of the concrete and fill them with calcium silicate hydrate by way of a chemical reaction. Concrete is protected from deep within all the way to the surface. Now that the slab is protected you will need to polish the concrete to create a look similar to one found at a big box commercial retail outlet. By polishing the slab you are essentially etching the surface, smoothing out the concrete, giving the surface a brilliant shine. By using a concrete densifier and then polishing the concrete you are not only protecting the concrete but you are also visually enhancing the appearance as well.If you are looking to keep the concrete looking natural but want the floor to be oil, grease and salt resistant the best product to use is the Siloxa-Tek 8510. The Siloxa-Tek 8510 is an invisible, penetrating sealer of a silane/siloxane chemistry that protects concrete from staining.On the other hand if you are looking for a high gloss finish with incredible chemical, abrasion and acid protection the best products to use are the Epoxy 325as a primer and the Urethane 645 as a top coat. The epoxy and urethane are available clear or colored.

Concrete Sealer


						
							
							
								
								It is always a good idea to do your research when buying a concrete sealer. However, you will be taken back by the multitude of information available online about concrete sealers. One brand will claim to do this, another brand will claim to do that but keep in mind every sealer is different for every consumer. Some projects will require a penetrating sealer while other projects will require a coating or an epoxy system. Other factors include location (temperature, weather and condition of the slab.) The proper application will vary depending on the different project parameter.To put it simply, we can break concrete sealers down into two categories: penetrating sealers, or concrete coatings. Concrete coatings, also known as acrylics, epoxies and urethanes, are solutions that are made up of larger sealing particles. These large particles will not fit through the tiny pores or penetrate through the surface of concrete. Instead, they will remain on the surface, acting like a raincoat for the concrete to help resist water. Of course, like a raincoat they will not keep water out indefinitely; they are simply water resistant, not waterproof.Penetrating sealers on the other hand consists of silicates, siliconates, silane/siloxanes, or a blend of the above. These sealers are densifiers, hardeners, water repellents and help to reduce mold, mildew and efflorescence. With the smaller particle size these sealers are able to penetrate and chemically react with the concrete forming calcium silciate hydrate or a hydrophobic barrier preventing the passage of water. All the hairline cracks, voids and pores of the concrete are sealed creating a stronger, denser concrete slab.

Why Do I Need to Polish Concrete


						
							
							
								
								Concrete is something of a paradox. While it is incredibly strong, durable, and long-lasting, it is also riddled throughout with tiny holes, pores that begin on the surface and branch out within the material. These pores are the result of concretes mixing process. Concrete is made up of three main ingredients: Portland cement, water, and an aggregate like sand or gravel. The mixing of these three parts is followed by the pouring of the concrete, which leads to the curing of the concrete resulting in what we think of as actual, finished concrete.However, there is no reason that concrete project needs to be thought of as finished. The surface of concrete is marked by a near-infinite number of tiny pores through which moisture and gas pass through. These networks of pores, as noted earlier, extend throughout the concrete, allowing the passage of moisture and gas in one side of the concrete and out the other. Initially, it can seem perplexing why a material renowned to be as strong as concrete would be dotted with tiny holes and hairline cracks, weaknesses in its construction.However, if you want to rid your concrete of the surface pores, you can polish the material. Polishing concrete is a way of densifying the concrete without using a concrete sealer. The polishing process occurs on the surface of the concrete, consisting of someone using machinery or chemicals to seal the surface pores by physically shaving off the concretes top layer. We recommend using Lithi-Tek 4500 first and then polishing the concrete. Once that top layer of concrete is polished and sheared off, the concrete is not susceptible to spills and water damage from its surface.The main benefit to polished concrete floors is that they never need waxing or sealing. They are rendered impervious to the vicissitudes of daily wear and tear through the polishing process. The process typically consists of a concrete professional, or at least someone with experience polishing concrete before, will grind the surface of the concrete with some machine, typically with a diamond-edged grinder. This will shave off the surface of the concrete while sealing the surface pores. Instead of the slightly rough surface that is typically associated with concrete, you will now have a smooth, polished surface that will need little maintenance while being protected from potential damages. Polished concrete is a great way to seal and maintain your concrete floors without using any other products.

Pressure Washing Concrete


						
							
							
								
								If you have decided to use a concrete sealing product on the concrete protecting your home, then you have made an excellent choice. However, it will not be at its most effective with a simple application. In order for the concrete sealer to either bond to optimal strength, or penetrate to optimal depth, you need to make sure the surface of the concrete is clean and ready for application.If your concrete has been newly poured, make sure to wait until it has fully cured. The curing process, if done correctly, typically takes around thirty days to properly dry and set to its full strength. An improper curing process, or the application of a concrete sealer before the concrete has set, can be disastrous to the longevity of the material. However, if you treat your concrete with a sealing product after thirty days, depending on your specific project, you should be perfectly fine in applying a concrete sealer to the material.However, if you have never treated your concrete with a concrete sealer, or if you need to reapply a sealer after a number of years, it is important that you properly clean the concrete surface you are working with. The best way to clean an exterior slab is by power washing also known as pressure washing. Power washing is a lot easier than acid etching, which may also be necessary depending on the situation of your concrete, and it will ensure that your concrete surface is cleared of debris, dirt, and dust that can get in the way of the concrete sealers proper function. Once the slab has been power washed, there will no longer be particles in the way to prevent a surface sealer from bonding. Surface sealers rely on a strong adhesive bond with the surface of the concrete substrate. Debris and dirt can get in the way of the bond, leading to inadequate protection and future problems. If the concrete is still dirty after powerwashing, use a concrete cleaner and etcher like the Hydro-Etch 1000.

How to Seal Concrete with Radiant Floor Heating


						
							
							
								
								With the cost of natural gases and oil rising in many parts of the country, upcoming winters promise to present a difficult choice between heating your home and living somewhat uncomfortably while wearing many layers. However, it doesnt have to be that black and white of a decision. A newer phenomenon among those home and business owners with concrete floors is radiant floor heating.Radiant floor heating is a method of heating concrete floors, walls, and other surfaces with tubes running underneath the concrete. Concrete can get very cold, especially in the winter. Anyone who has walked over a bare concrete floor in the winter knows that feeling of iciness that permeates through the soles of your feet to creep through the rest of your body. Radiant floor heating offers an ingenious and cost effective way to heat up those floors while saving you money on your heat, electric, and gas bills.While it is easier to install a radiant floor heating system before you pour your concrete slabs, its not impossible to add to a pre-existing concrete floor. If you havent yet poured the concrete, however, the process is as simple as installing a network of small tubes designed to carry either hot water or electrical current under your floors, which leads to them heating up and spreading that heat (or having that heat radiate, which is where the name comes from) throughout the rest of the concrete slab. Remember to seal the concrete slab with a concrete sealer like the Lithi-Tek 9500 for additional protection.If you have a pre-existing concrete floor to which you want to add a radiant floor system, you simply have to add thin electrical current system mats under another layer of cement or gypsum overlay. Okay, maybe that isnt so simple, but it certainly isnt impossible. This method will add a radiant floor heating system to your home without significantly raising the height of your concrete floors.Whichever route you go, a radiant floor heating system is a great, cost effective way to heat otherwise freezing concrete floors and walls throughout the colder months. It is not even necessarily just a fix for those living in places with harsh winters. Concrete is, by nature, a cold material, even in the summer or in warmer climates. If you or members of your family are sensitive to cold, it would be a good idea to look into radiant floor heating systems as a potential fix.

Best Sealer for an Outdoor Fireplace


						
							
							
								
								One of the biggest benefits to concrete is its typical lack of flammability. While it can catch on fire in special circumstances, it is not as susceptible to flames as a substance like wood or vinyl, which flare up in a matter of minutes. This quality of concrete makes it an attractive choice for construction and use in basements and for floors, but it also makes it a great choice for someone looking to build and install an outdoor fireplace.Outdoor fireplaces are great gathering spots for families and friends, helping to provide a pleasing aesthetic and physical atmosphere for a night of bonding. Many fireplaces are increasingly being constructed from concrete, due to that materials excellent properties of strength, durability, and longevity. However, one step many homeowners are forgetting is to seal their outdoor fireplaces. Concrete outdoor fireplaces are located directly in the elements with no reprieve from the rain, snow, or other such sources of wear that can degrade and corrupt your concrete over time. While outdoor fireplaces are not integral to the structural integrity of your home, you certainly do not want to have to replace the fireplace constantly due to preventable damage.If your fireplace is made out of a material like brick, concrete or stone you will want to treat it with a silane/siloxane blend sealer like Siloxa-Tek 8500. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 will protect the surface of your substrate repelling water and snow melt from entering the material, thereby increasing the fireplaces longevity.

How to Stamp Concrete


						
							
							
								
								While concrete has been around for ages, it is constantly being modified and improved through various technological processes. The pyramids in Egypt are considered to be one of the first uses of concrete, though they are far different from what we think of as concrete now. Without this constant change and enhancement, concrete would have lost its place as the most common man-made material on Earth.One of the newer forms of concrete is stamped concrete. Stamped concrete is just concrete that has been specially patterned to look like some other building material, such as brick or stucco. By using stamped concrete, the homeowner or construction professional can achieve a visually appealing look without sacrificing any of concretes noted and desired strength. Stamped concrete tends to be used for interior flooring, patios, pool decks, and even driveways typically projects that deal with concrete slabs that are not subjected to high levels of foot traffic.The steps to creating stamped concrete are fairly complicated, and really should only be left to concrete professionals  it typically is not recommended as a do-it-yourself project unless you already have some experience laying concrete. That being said, the process is relatively straightforward. You simply mix concrete, pouring it into the slab you want, just as if you were pouring normal concrete. Then, you add the color hardener, or other type of coloring additive to the already-poured concrete. Once the proper steps are taken to ensure a uniform layer of color at the pitch and hue you want, then you can begin the actual stamping process.Before you can stamp concrete, you need to purchase expensive stamping equipment. These are just extremely large stamps that made into certain patterns. Some stamps can come in hexagons, while others can be patterned to look like a brick wall. Once the stamp is chosen, you lay the stamp down over the poured concrete, tamping it down with a great deal of force to imprint the stamp on the concrete. Once the tamping has finished, you need to remove the stamp and etch the divisions where needed. After this step, the process is finished, and you just need to cure the concrete properly as you would any normal batch of concrete. To enhance the appearance of the newly stamped concrete seal it with Cryli-Tek 5505 or Cryli-Tek 5500.Overall, while the process is a great way to beautify and add a different visual aesthetic to your concrete without sacrificing anything in the way of strength, durability, and longevity, stamped concrete is not a job for the amateur do-it-yourselfer looking for a weekend project. You would, in fact, be far better off if you hired concrete professionals to pour, stamp, and cure your concrete.

Best Sealer for Auto Showroom or Car Dealership


						
							
							
								
								When installing a concrete floor in a place like an auto showroom in a car dealership, it is important that your concrete remains strong and durable, despite the high levels of wear it is likely to encounter. the constant trek of car tires as you move cars indoors and outdoors will gradually wear down even concrete, that material renowned for its strength.While concrete tends to be of a roughly uniform level of strength, there are ways to improve its durability and resistance to wear, abrasion, and various chemical spills. The foremost solution is to treat the concrete floors with a quality concrete sealer. Concrete sealers, when chosen and applied properly, offer comprehensive levels of protection that will last for a long time. However, it is important to choose the right type of sealer for your particular project.For the concrete floor of a car dealership, you will want to choose an epoxy floor system. Epoxy floor systems are surface-level sealers, as opposed to penetrating sealers. A penetrating sealer is not necessary for an indoor car dealership floor because you are more concerned with wear, abrasion, and stains from car fluids than any sort of penetrating water damage  the greatest threat to your floors is at the surface level.Epoxy systems are applied in coats. There is typically at least one epoxy basecoat that bonds firmly to the concrete substrate, giving the entire system a strong grounding. Next, there tends to be another epoxy coat, which further increases protection, durability, and longevity. Then, if you so desire, you can add paint chips to the second layer of epoxy, which gives your floors a visual boost, which can be especially important in a venue like a car dealership where visual appeal is most of the game. Finally, the entire project is sealed with a clear urethane or polyaspartic topcoat. These types of topcoats are incredibly resilient and strong, featuring high levels of abrasion and wear resistance, while also not allowing spills to penetrate past their surfaces. They give the floors that look that is not too shiny, but also not entirely matte  the perfect visual for the floor of a car dealership.Epoxy 325 primer followed by the Urethane 645 top coat is an excellent choice for a concrete sealing epoxy system. It features a water-based epoxy basecoat, finished with a urethane topcoat featuring excellent wear and abrasion resistance, all while protecting the floor from discoloring or other negative effects of chemicals and abrasions. The Ghostshield products are designed for strength and protection, as well as longevity and ease of application you will not find a more cost effective offering on the market offering the same level of comprehensive protection.

Concrete Sealers and De-icing Salts


						
							
							
								
								One of the biggest dangers to your concrete is the weather. More than wear, abrasion, and chemical spills, weathering from the elements can degrade and erode your concrete structures quickly over a relatively short period of time. Concrete should, in theory, last for thousands of years. However, without proper protection, their longevity is greatly reduced, especially in areas plagued by harsh winters.Winters are the worst season for your concrete. The freeze/thaw cycle, for instance, can ruin your concrete in one season. As water seeps into concrete in the warmer months before winter, the pores of the concrete retain that moisture, locking it into the material. Then, when the winter cold strikes, the water within the concrete will freeze into ice, expanding to enlarge the pores and take up more space within the concrete. At this stage it is already too late to protect the concrete, and when spring comes with its thaw will cause that ice within the concrete to melt. With that melting will come cracking, as the pores within the concrete have expanded too large to shrink back. In as little as one season, the concrete can be riddled with cracks and full of potential problems for the future.The easiest way to protect the concrete from this problem is to use a concrete sealer. The right concrete sealers will stop water from entering the concrete slab, locking out that potentially disastrous moisture. However, one of the potential problems with concrete sealers and the winter comes with de-icing salts. De-icing salts meant to prevent water from freezing on the surface of concrete can often interfere with the protective qualities of concrete sealers. The problem is that de-icing salts actually create potentially hundreds of freeze/thaw cycles each day. With the continuous wear, the concrete surface sealer will quickly become compromised, allowing more and more water to enter the concrete slab past its defenses.The best way to prevent this problem is not to stop using de-icing salts: that would be dangerous. Instead, you should treat your concrete with a concrete sealer. The concrete sealer will increase the protection, giving surface and penetrating protection. Use a concrete sealer like Siloxa-Tek 8500, Siloxa-Tek 8505 or Siloxa-Tek 8510 for comprehensive deicing salt protection.

How to Apply an Epoxy or Urethane Sealer


						
							
							
								
								Epoxy and urethane sealers are typically polymer solutions that are rolled onto the surface of a concrete slab, giving it excellent abrasion and spill resistance while enhancing the concretes visual appeal. Epoxies and urethanes are much stronger than acrylic sealers, making it a much better choice if you need a surface sealer in a high traffic area. They are frequently used in large retail stores, industrial areas, and warehouse floors; they are even used in most airports.Application Instructions are as follows:Avoid contact with skin, eyes and clothing. Wash hands after use and do not take internally. Please refer to the product Safety Data Sheet (SDS) before using. The preparation process should be followed to ensure adequate penetration and optimum performance:Step 1: The concrete substrate must be structurally sound, thoroughly dry and clean.Step 2: Remove all paints, previous sealers and/or adhesives before application.Step 3: The substrate must be clean of oil, grease, dirt, wax, curing compounds, efflorescence and other contaminants that might interfere with the penetration of the sealer.Step 4: For a one or two coat thin build system (3-10 mils dry) we recommend either mechanical scarification or acid etching until a suitable profile is achieved. For a complete system build higher than 10 mils dry, we recommend a fine brush blast (shot blast). If acid is used to clean the concrete, neutralize the surface completely and rinse it with water prior to application. Then wait for the concrete to dry out for at least 24-48 hours.Step 5: The surface-zone moisture content of the concrete should not exceed 4%wt. A test should be made to determine that the concrete has an appropriate vapor barrier. This can be done by placing a 4’X4’ plastic sheet on the substrate and taping down the edges. If after 24 hours, the substrate is still dry below the plastic sheet, then the substrate does not show signs of eventual hydrostatic pressure problems that may later cause disbanding.Step 6: Cover all surrounding areas not intended to be coated.Step 7: New concrete must be cured for at least 28 days before sealing.Mixing: This product comes pre-packaged by weight. Kits should be mixed in their entirety. Epoxy 325 A and Epoxy 325 B should be thoroughly mixed before combining. Scrape the bottom and sides of each container. Epoxy 325 A and Epoxy 325 B can then be combined (Epoxy 325 is sold as a pre-packaged kit and Epoxy 325 Part A should be mixed in its entirety with Epoxy 325 Part B). After the two parts are combined, mix well with slow speed mixing equipment such as a jiffy mixer until the material is thoroughly mixed and streak free. This product is an emulsion product and should be mixed well before using.Application: Test the sealer in an inconspicuous area to ensure the desired coverage and appearance is achieved. The mixed material can be applied by brush or roller. Workable time is about 1 hour. Maintain temperatures within the recommended ranges during the application and curing process. Apply material with relative humidity within the parameters. When the end of the pot life has been reached, you will find that the material becomes hard to apply and will actually tend to roll back up onto the roller. Do not try to continue application when the coating has reached this step. Applications made at different times with differing environmental conditions, may show slight variations in gloss. Coverage is approximately 200 sq. ft. per gallon. Make sure you test the surface for dryness prior to use and allow at least 8 hours before walking. A full cure will take up to 7 days to complete.Recoating/Topcoating: If you opt to recoat or topcoat this product, you must first be sure that all of the solvents and water have evaporated from the coating during the curing process. However, it is best to test the coating before recoating or topcoating. This can be done by pressing on the coating with your thumb to verify that no fingerprint impression is left. If no impression is created, then the recoat or topcoat can be started. Always remember that colder temperatures will require more cure time for the product before recoating or topcoating can commence. Before recoating or topcoating, check the coating to insure no epoxy blushes were developed (a whitish, greasy film or deglossing). If a blush is present, it must be removed prior to topcoating or recoating. A standard type detergent cleaner can be used to remove any blush. Many epoxy overlays and coatings as well as urethanes are compatible for use as a topcoat for this product as well as multiple coats of this product.Application Notes:Restrict the use of the floor to light traffic and non-harsh chemicals until the coating is fully cured. It is best to let the floor remain dry for the full cure cycle. Dependent on actual complete system application, surface may be slippery, especially when wet or contaminated; keep surface clean and dry.Some cleaners may affect the color of the floor installed. Test each cleaner in a small area, utilizing your cleaning technique. If no ill effects are noted, you can continue to clean with the product and process tested.The clear is not water clear (it is an amber clear) and is not suitable for topcoating over previously color coated floors. The clear is suitable as a primer or concrete sealer only.Color or gloss may be affected by humidity, low temperatures, chemical exposure or sodium vapor lighting.Product will yellow in the presence of UV light.For best results use a 1/4” or 3/8” nap roller.Slab on grade requires moisture barrier.Substrate temperature must be 5°F above dew point.All new concrete must be cured for at least 28 days.Product color will vary from batch to batch. Use only product from the same batch for an entire job.Improper mixing or too thick of an application may result in product failure.Light or bright colors (white, etc.) may require multiple coats or a topcoat to achieve a satisfactory hide, depending on the substrate.For added chemical resistance, color stability or UV stability, topcoat with Urethane 645.

How to Waterproof a Basement


						
							
							
								
								Basements are areas of our homes that leave the house vulnerable to damage. Water damage typically will not plague a home, even on the ground floor. However, since basements are actually located underground, they are at a higher risk of damage from the elements, especially water damage.Water damage typically occurs from flooding. While flooding can be a surprise occurrence, due to flash floods or a natural disaster like a hurricane, the flooding that can regularly plague basements generally builds up over time. Areas near rivers, lakes, oceans, and other bodies of water have high water tables. This just means there is a large amount of water pooled beneath the surface of the ground. When the water table is high, there is a greater chance of flooding because water from rain cannot sink into the earth to as great of an extent as in places with a low water table.Basements in areas with high hydrostatic pressure, which is when the water table is high, are prone to water damage. While concrete seems strong and impervious to water flowing through it, it is actually a porous material. Its mixing process results in a large number of tiny air pockets that allow water and moisture to pass through the material. While trace amounts of moisture are not a problem, water can physically pass through the concrete and drip through the walls, leading to mold and mildew build-up, as well as damaging your home and possessions.If you are actively experiencing water or moisture it is best to use a two step process. First use the Lithi-Tek 4500 as a primer followed up seven days later by the Siloxa-Tek 8500 as a topcoat. If you are preventatively sealing and looking for the most cost effective option the best product to use is the Lithi-Tek 9500. The Lithi-Tek 9500 sealer will penetrate past the surface of the concrete to react chemically within the material. The chemical reaction not only increases the concretes density and strength, but it also fills in the pores and hairline cracks that allow the uninhibited passage of moisture into the concrete.

How to Prevent Freeze-Thaw Damage


						
							
							
								
								Freeze/thaw damage is a perennial danger that plagues contractors, architects, professional builders, road maintenance workers, and homeowners alike. The elements cannot be avoided and outsmarted, and freeze/thaw damage is almost an inevitability in places plagued by harsh winters.Freeze/thaw cycles damage your concrete because there is already a large amount of water within the concrete when winter comes. When the concrete has been saturated with water, either due to a poor mixing process or due to a lack of concrete sealer, the concrete will freeze in the winter. The water inside the concrete causes the material to freeze, which then leads to expansion as the water needs more room to freeze and become rigid. Now, the concretes structural integrity has been compromised, and when that ice begins to melt, the concrete will crack. The cracks are unavoidable once the water within the concrete has frozen.Concrete is filled with a large number of pores that hold water if the concrete is exposed to a large quantity of water. While moisture passage through the concrete is expected and not harmful, it becomes problematic when the water does not pass through, instead sitting within the material. At this point, it is too late to avoid freeze/thaw damage, as there is really no way to draw water from concrete.The only way to prevent freeze/thaw damage is to treat your concrete with a quality concrete sealer. Siloxa-Tek 8500 or Siloxa-Tek 8505 are the best sealers to use to prevent freeze-thaw damage and prevent the incursion of water into the concrete. As penetrating sealers, these products will seep deep into the concrete to structurally bond to the material, locking out water permanently. With the water locked out of the concrete, there is nothing to freeze when winter comes, thereby protecting your concrete from cracks when winter is over.

Best Concrete Sealers for Subfloors


						
							
							
								
								Concrete is one of the most structurally durable materials on earth, which makes it a no-brainer for many construction projects. However, while you can decorate concrete slightly, it really is not the most visually flexible material. Concrete floors provide excellent structure and support, but they are more limited when it comes to visual appeal. How do you solve this problem?One way that is increasingly becoming more popular is to have a concrete floor underneath a vinyl acrylic tile covering. Once the concrete has been poured and cured for at least thirty days, vinyl acrylic tiling can be glued to the concrete floor. This way, the floor is structurally made from concrete, giving it strength, durability, and longevity. However, it also has that aesthetic appeal, with regard to the vinyl covering that can be customized in any way you want it.The biggest potential problem with concrete subfloors is that the concrete can be prone to damage, especially from water underneath. While it depends on the environmental conditions in your area, concrete has the potential to allow water to seep through. It is a very porous material by nature of its mixing process, which leaves it prone to the passage of water and moisture. While this can be a problem for normal concrete floors and surfaces, it can be an absolute disaster for someone with a vinyl floor covering a concrete one.Luckily, there is an easy preventative fix. Instead of forgoing the fashionable and inexpensive process of having a concrete floor covered by a vinyl acrylic tile covering, you simply have to seal the concrete with a waterproofing concrete sealer before adding the vinyl tiling. Once the concrete has been cured properly, you can add a penetrating concrete sealer like Lithi-Tek 9500 which will penetrate deep into the concrete to lock out water. With the water locked out, there is no way for it to get to the surface and cause the nasty bubbling and flaking of your vinyl tiling. Your floor, at both the concrete and vinyl tiling levels, will be protected.

Best Concrete Sealer


						
							
							
								
								While there are a number of different types of concrete sealing products that are often specifically applicable to your projects, there are some concrete sealers that are more or less universally appropriate. If you are tired to searching the Internet for miniscule differences, confused by all of the technical jargon and just ready to begin your concrete sealing project, you probably just want to know what the best overall all-in-one concrete sealer is.The Lithi-Tek 9500 is the best all-in-one concrete sealer on the market. The Lithi-Tek 9500 is a water-based penetrating concrete sealer that will seep past the surface pores of the concrete to react chemically within the material. This chemical reaction will cause naturally occurring elements within the concrete to harden and densify, filling in other pores and hairline cracks to make the concrete resist damage and last longer.The Lithi-Tek 9500 is not only just a penetrating concrete sealer: it also densifiers, waterproofs, and serves as a vapor barrier, all in one product. It even is a cure and seal product, which is a really important trait that helps cure and protect newly poured concrete, making the Lithi-Tek 9500 extremely versatileThe comprehensive protection offered by the Lithi-Tek 9500 is backed by an equally comprehensive guarantee of service. It will create a breathable film that allows the passage of trace amounts of moisture out of the concrete, and it only needs one coat that covers a substantial amount of area. Finally, the product is shipped to the consumer in its concentrated form, allowing the customer to mix the product as he/she sees fit, according to the instructions. This way you know exactly what the ratios of chemical to water are, allowing you to apply the product so it gives the best layer of protection.Ultimately, the Lithi-Tek 9500 is the best all-in-one concrete sealer on the market. While it is advisable to research your particular project thoroughly, the Lithi-Tek 9500 is the best option for those projects that can be serviced by a few different types of concrete sealer. In fact, the Lithi-Tek 9500 will work better than most products on the market, regardless of the specialty, as it was research, designed, and engineered to offer the most comprehensive and thorough standard of protection for your concrete.

Best Sealer for a Wine Cellar


						
							
							
								
								Wine cellars are part of a home or business that usually do not get as much attention as more highly trafficked areas. Unlike a garage or a traditional basement, they are hardly integral to the structure or function of your home or business. However, they can house an expensive and valuable collection of wine that often requires perfect environmental conditions to ensure the preservation of the liquids.Most wine cellars, like regular cellars and basements, are constructed from concrete. A strong, durable material, concrete can last forever and will protect your interior from the perils of the outdoors. However, concrete is far from a solid material. While it is extremely strong, concrete is also incredibly porous, which is a direct result of its mixing process. Concrete is really just a mixture of a few different materials that bind together to create the final material we call concrete. A by-product of this mixing process is a large number of holes and tiny air pockets that fill the concrete, making it porous and susceptible to the passage of water or potentially harmful natural gases like methane and radon.Concrete that has just been poured and cured, even properly cured, will not be up to its optimal potential strength. Instead, that concrete needs to be treated with a concrete sealer. A wine cellar requires a quality concrete sealer more than a typical basement, as its contents tend to be more precious than those of the average basement.For a concrete wine cellar, the best choice in concrete sealer would be a silane/siloxane sealer, like Siloxa-Tek 8505. The Siloxa-Tek 8505 contains particles that will penetrate into the concrete material past the surface pores, filling the concretes porous holes and cracks with its material. This protects the concrete from the incursion of water, all while increasing the materials strength and durability. The Siloxa-Tek 8505 sealer will also seal the surface of the concrete resisting staining, working on both levels to protect your wine cellar. As a water-based offering, the Siloxa-Tek 8505 is safe for application indoors, protecting your concrete for years to come.

								Basements are one of the weakest points in your home, yet they are also one of the most important. The foundations of your home are in the basement, as that room is what your home literally stands on. Similarly, they offer great spaces for storage and renovation, increasing the value of your home enormously.However, as they are below the normally occupied areas of your house, they can be at risk of damage from water and natural gases. This is especially true for those people who live near bodies of water: lakes, rivers, ponds, the ocean, etc. In areas where bodies of surface water are found, there are high water tables, which increase the risk of basement flooding. As there is already a high level of water beneath the grounds surface, water from rain cannot penetrate and gather in the ground. That water builds up to create hydrostatic pressure, which is a primary culprit in basement flooding.Basements are typically made of poured concrete. While concrete may seem impenetrable, it is actually a very porous material. There are a large number of air bubbles throughout the material, leaving it vulnerable to the incursion of water. When hydrostatic pressure builds and flooding occurs, that water can force itself through the concrete to drip into your basement, leading to problems with mold, mildew, flooding, and water damage.Fortunately, it is easy to help prevent such water damage in your basement. The use of a penetrating sealer, like Lithi-Tek 9500 will increase the concretes strength while reacting chemically inside of the material to help lock out water by filling in those tiny air pockets. The Lithi-Tek LS 9500 is a great choice because it is a water-based product, making it much safer to apply indoors as you do not have to worry about hazardous fumes and flammability. With the proper application, the Lithi-Tek 9500 will help protect your basement from water damage, ensuring your property and your valuables remain safe from the elements.

Silane-Siloxane Concrete Sealers


						
							
							
								
								Silane-Siloxane concrete sealers are water repellent sealers made up of a formulation of silane and siloxane. When blended together they are a power team causing water to bead off the surface with long lasting results. Product recommendation: The best silane/siloxane concrete sealer to use is the SILOXA-TEK 8510. Benefits: Benefits include protection from salts, water, efflorescence, mold, mildew, freeze-thaw cycles and staining from oils and greases. They are extremely versitile products able to protect brick, masonry, stone, concrete blocks, pavers, stucco, tile, sandstone and slate.Coverage: Up to 300 square feet per gallon. Two coats are recommended and the listed coverage is per coat. Finish: Siloxa-Tek 8510 concrete sealer leaves a clear, natural finish.  Availability: Siloxa-Tek 8510 is available in one gallon or five gallon containers.  Tip: Apply two coats wet-one-wet. This means the second coat is applied right after the first coat or within five minutes of applying the first coat.  Why Ghostshield: The Ghostshield Siloxa-Tek products work better and last longer than conventional sealers because they contain a unique blend of compounds that impregnate concrete below the surface. This reaction forms an insoluble, water-repellent barrier within the surface that cannot wear away, fade, yellow, crack or peel. They all resist freeze-thaw damage and deicing salts. All the Siloxa-Tek products are high actives with the 8505 and 8510 offering staining protection. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 and 8505 are water based while the 8510 is solvent based.

Best Sealer for Kennels


						
							
								How to determine the best concrete sealer for a kennel. Concrete sealers used in kennels will protect from stains, keep out odors, and allow for easy clean up of urine, bodily fluids and chemicals.

							
								
								If you've ever been in a kennel, or even used one to house your animals, you know the unpleasant smell that can plague some of establishments that arent as clean. Sometimes, it is not even a black mark on the kennels cleanliness, but an indictment of their concrete. Most kennels are made from poured concrete that serves as the floor for the dog-residents to rest on. However, many kennels do not seal their concrete, leading to a painstaking and tiresome cleaning process every time an animal has an accident.Even after the accident has been cleaned, the smell can linger. This is because the offending particles, either urine or solid waste, seeps into the pores of the concrete, becoming part of the floor itself. Once this has happened, it is extremely difficult and often impossible to remove.Benefits to sealing a kennel:Easy clean up of urine, bodily fliuds, dirt and chemicalsStain resistanceKeep out odorsAbrasion resistant: will not peel or chip when in contact with animal nailsIf you are looking for easy to clean floors that will stop the penetration of ureic acid, resist abrasions, chemicals and odors use a durable coating epoxy and urethane system.If you are looking to keep the concrete floor natural without any gloss or sheen use a penetrating concrete sealer. Keep in mind spills and accidents need to be cleaned up in a timely manner to prevent staining.
								Why Ghostshield?
								There are a couple of different options on the market for sealing kennels. Some people opt for epoxy systems, which consists of an epoxy primer like the EPOXY 325 followed by the URETHANE 645 topcoat. They are available clear or colored and leave a gloss finish. They are excellent options for kennels because they completely resist the penetration of acids and chemicals allowing for easy clean up. By using a durable concrete coating system you will be able to wipe up the messes on the surface level without any intensive scrubbing. Also since the Epoxy 325 and Urethane 645 are extremely abrasion resistant you do not have to worry about the coatings peeling, chipping or delaminating when exposed to nails and animals running. The other option is to go with a natural finish penetrating sealer like the SILOXA-TEK 8510. The 8510 will help to resist staining and will cause fluids to bead up from the concrete instead of being absorbed into the concrete. The penetrating sealer will also ensure that your floors are slip resistant rather than creating a film on the surface, the concrete retains its original surface texture.

Concrete Shower and Bath Sealers


						
							
								Seal a concrete shower and bath with a penetrating, non-slip concrete sealer in order to make cleaning easier and prevent the growth of mold and mildew. 
							
								
								While concrete may not be your first thought when you are designing your shower and bath, it has increasingly become a common material used. It provides a sleek, modern look all while being extremely easy to clean. The concrete will not have grout and joints where mold can build up, requiring less cleaning and maintenance than a traditional shower.The biggest problem with using concrete in your shower is the materials porosity. Concrete is very porous by nature, which allows the absorption and passage of water through untreated concrete. Therefore, it is important to properly seal your concrete showers, baths, and sinks with a high quality concrete sealer. Penetrating concrete sealers leave natural finishes so the concrete will not be slippery when wet. 
								Why Ghostshield?
								Apply the SILOXA-TEK 8510 penetrating concrete sealer. The Siloxa-Tek 8510 will penetrate deep within the concrete through the tiny surface pores, while filling in tiny hairline cracks and air pockets to prevent the seepage of water into the material while simultaneously reducing the growth and frequency of mold and mildew.

Best Sealer for Concrete Restoration


						
							
							
								
								While concrete is known to be an incredibly durable and long-lasting material (check out those pyramids, still standing strong with one of the first forms of concrete) poorly mixed and poorly cured concrete is an unfortunate daily occurrence. Crumbling buildings, cracked sidewalks, and other such visual eyesores and structural time-bombs all point to an industry whose concrete is not always of the utmost quality.If you find yourself saddled with old, crumbling concrete, you certainly want to do something about it, both to protect your investment and to make sure there are no potential structural flaws that could cause damage to your home. While the best way to prevent the problem is to make sure the concrete has been properly mixed, poured, and cured, sometimes we do not have this control. The next best step would be to treat your concrete with a high-quality concrete sealer, to protect it from all sorts of weathering.The typical method of restoring spalled, cracked, and crumbling concrete is through a multi-step process. Depending on the extent of the damage, the depth of the project will vary. First you will need to patch and fill any cracks. Next you will want to use the Siloxa-Tek 8510 to help protect your concrete from future problems, such as cracking and spalling due to constant UV exposure, extreme weathering, or moisture seepage into the material.

Shop Floor System


						
							
							
								
								A shop floor is one of the most at-risk places for concrete damage. The amount of traffic, either from people or heavy machinery, is extremely high, making the potential for damage proportionally elevated. In particular, shop floors can suffer from abrasions and chemical spills, both of which can mar the surface of the concrete floors.A shop floor system provides thorough and comprehensive protection for your high traffic floors. It is a high build concrete coating system that is made up of a water-based epoxy priming coat, finished with a urethane topcoat to help increase wear resistance. In addition to all of the structural protections, you can add a layer of aggregate, such as decorative paint chips or sand, to help give character to your concrete floors.Ghostshield recommends the following products in a :Primer: Epoxy 325: is a water-borne, two component, epoxy designed to prime concrete floors.Top Coat: Urethane 645: is a 65% solids two-component clear polyester/aliphatic polyurethane coating.

Best Sealer for Concrete Countertops


						
							
							
								
								When you decide to install new countertops in your kitchen, there are a number of options. You could choose timeless butcherblock, chintzy laminate, or classy granite. However, one of the newer material options is the concrete countertop. Concrete is fast becoming a preferred material for constructing kitchen countertops, especially considering the health concerns associated with granite countertops emitting potentially cancer-causing radon.The benefits of concrete countertops, on the other hand, are many. For instance, it can be filled with colored materials or decorative particles such as quartz or marble, giving the concrete the look of a number of different stones, like granite, for a fraction of the cost. It is inexpensive and incredibly durable, lasting for long periods of time with little upkeep. They arent easily damaged from knives or dropped pots and pans, and they can be protected from stains with a simple sealing regimen.Periodic sealing, maybe once every three years or so, will ensure your concrete countertops remain fresh and protected for the long haul. While the biggest threat to your concrete countertops would probably be acidic stains, like lemon juice, as well as other stains from tomato sauce or red wine. By choosing the proper sealer that will protect against heat, scratches, and other dangers, these stains will not seep into the concrete, instead sitting atop the material to be cleaned up at your leisure.There is currently a debate in the concrete community of professionals about which sealing method is best for kitchen countertops. The consensus has gradually shifted to topical/penetrating sealer blends like Concrete Countertop Sealer 660 followed up with a concrete wax which will protect your concrete from heat and scratches and against stains. The combination of the two products will protect your concrete from stains, heat, and scratches, allowing you to cook and take advantage of your beautiful countertops without anxiety.

Graffiti Prevention and Removal for Concrete


						
							
							
								
								For whatever reason, spraying graffiti and tagging structures is a timeless act of youthful rebellion. Frequently, the vandals paint on concrete surfaces, such as walls, bridge abutments, and other such juicy targets. The removal of graffiti is a time consuming and potentially costly project, depending on the materials used and the scope of the vandalism.The best way to deal with graffiti is to prevent it. At the very least, there are certain products that will make the graffiti easy to remove. The Lithi-Tek 9500 is an excellent option to ease the removal of graffiti.  Although the graffiti paint will adhere to the 9500, if you take a pressure washer to the concrete the graffiti will come right off and will make it more difficult for the offending material to bond to the wall, often even causing it to slide off the concrete. The treatment of your concrete with the Lithi-Tek 9500 will also help to protect your concrete from extreme weathering and UV rays from the sun, helping to keep your concrete fresh and durable. When all those benefits are added to the visual benefit of helping prevent graffiti or even just to lessen the typically painstaking cleaning process  the use of the Lithi-Tek 9500 on your concrete at-risk for vandalism is a no-brainer.

Moisture Reducing Epoxies


						
							
							
								
								One of the biggest dangers to concrete is water or any other type of sustained moisture exposure. If there is too much water present in the concrete, it could lead to unpleasant side effects like mildew and mold build-up, as well as potential water damage. Epoxy sealers are an excellent surface sealer option to protect such concrete as found on your garage floors.Epoxy sealers are a topical option, and will not penetrate into the pores on the surface of the concrete to react chemically within the material. However, they are often easier to apply, being a great choice for the average homeowner. They are also a great choice for various industrial and commercial projects.Moisture reducing epoxies are an even more effective and flexible option, as they are manufactured to withstand moist conditions. They are not, in fact, chemically or physically sensitive to certain quantities of moisture. This means that you can actually apply moisture reducing epoxies to surfaces that are not entirely dry, making it a great option for a perennially damp or moist slab of concrete.A typical epoxy sealer is created from the mixing of two components, leading to a thick and durable substance that can last for many years with only one coat. A moisture reducing epoxy like the Vapor-Tek 440 will improve the water resistance of your concrete up to 20lbs/24hr/1000ft allowing for the application of wood flooring, tile or any other floor covering.

Aliphatic Urethane


						
							
							
								
								Aliphatic urethane is the type of urethane that is most commonly used as the topcoat for epoxy floor systems. There are two other types of urethane: aromatic and waterborne. Aliphatic, however, is a better choice for concrete sealing because it will not turn to the color amber when exposed to UV light (from the sun), like aromatic urethanes will. While waterborne urethanes also will not amber, they are not as strong as aliphatic, which offers excellent abrasion and chemical resistance, as well as strong color and gloss retention. Aliphatic urethanes are most well known for offering UV stability and protection from the suns rays, and are highly resistant to severe weather, due to their chemical composition. Their bonds are extremely strong, and they typically last for a long time.Urethanes in general are used as a topcoat for epoxy floor systems, meaning they rarely are used as a standalone product. Epoxy floor systems are a series of products that are used on rougher floors that feature heavy traffic, such as in airports, commercial retail stores, or industrial settings. They typically consist of a primary coat of a basic epoxy, designed to bond to the substrate on the surface, much like an acrylic surface sealer. Because the particles of material are larger than with penetrating sealers, the epoxy will not delve within the concrete, instead pooling on the surface to be spread out evenly during application.After this epoxy base coat, you are ready to add the urethane topcoat. An aliphatic urethane, while slightly more expensive than aromatic, is really the only choice of topcoat. Aromatic will yellow at the slightest sunlight and will also not last nearly as long, as it is not as strong of a bond.Ghostshield offers an aliphatic urethane product Urethane 645. The Urethane 645 is a two-component urethane and is a great choices as a topcoat for your epoxy-sealed floors that offer an excellent level of protection.

Best Sealer for a Pool Deck


						
							
								How to determine the best concrete sealer for a pool deck whether you are looking for a natural finish, satin finish or wet look finish.
							
								
								While enormous cost can go into the installation and maintenance of the pool itself, the pool decks and patios are often overlooked, which can be a huge problem for homeowners.It is important to properly seal the concrete surrounding the pool to ensure that mold, mildew, salt water and damage from UV rays do not deteriorate or damage the pool deck.Pool decks are an important, if understated, aspect of your pool experience. If your pool patio is cracked and dirty, weeds will grow between the pavers, leading to a very unpleasant visual fade. There can also be structural danger caused by damage that can be extremely costly to repair. Fortunately, there is a cost effective and relatively easy way to protect your concrete pool decks and patios, and that is to use a concrete sealer.
								Why Ghostshield?
								If you are looking for a natural finish pool deck concrete sealer the best product to use is the SILOXA-TEK 8500. It is excellent if you are looking for a slip-free finish and it is great for use around a salt water pool since it will protect the pool deck from spalling pitting and cracking. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 concrete sealer will last up to ten years before another application.A solvent-based acrylic concrete sealer like the CRYLi-TEK 5505 is the best option if you are looking for a high gloss, wet look finish. It can be slippery when wet so it is recommended that a slip resistant additive such as the Grip-Tek 250 be added at time of application for added traction. A matting agent is also available to bring the gloss finish down to a satin or low sheen finish. This is the best option if you want to enhance the colors and textures of the concrete around a pool deck.A water-based acrylic concrete sealer like the CRYLI-TEK 5500 is best if you are looking for a water-based acrylic concrete sealer that will conform to environmental regulations while protecting your concrete with a strong film of large acrylic particles ensuring lasting protection.

Best Epoxy Concrete Sealers


						
							
							
								
								While penetrating and acrylic concrete sealers have their place in protecting and defending your concrete, epoxies can often be the right solution for your particular project. Epoxies are a type of solution that will provide solid and thorough protection through its coating. While it can be used as a standalone coating system, epoxy systems are even more popular.Epoxy systems are step-by-step processes that include an epoxy primer like the Epoxy 325 and urethane topcoat such as the Urethane 645. Typically, an epoxy will first be directly applied to the concrete substrate. This epoxy coating will be spread over the entire concrete surface, providing a solid layer of protection. After this layer, a topcoat  typically a urethane  will be applied over the epoxy base coat. This topcoat will be a substance that will dry clear, protecting the color and the epoxy base layers from spillage and other chemical or environmental conditions.Epoxies are a great choice for concrete surfaces that are marked by roughness and scratches. As they are a thicker, heavier substance, they offer comprehensive protection across the entirety of your floors or walls. Water-based epoxies such as the Epoxy 325 are a better choice if you live in a state like California or New York that has strict environmental laws regulating the use of chemicals. Water-based epoxies are also better for indoor applications, as the hazardous fumes associated with solvent-based epoxies can be harmful to your health if they arent allowed to dissipate.

Best Sealer for Stamped Concrete


						
							
							
								
								Stamped concrete is a type of concrete that is textured and covered in patterns in order to better resemble other materials, such as brick or wood. Typically used in pool decks, driveways, patios, and other such surfaces, stamped concrete is a decorative concrete.If you are looking for a decorative product for stamped concrete, you're better off choosing an acrylic sealer, whether solvent- or water-based to achieve maximum decorative results. Penetrating concrete sealers can also be used but will not any aesthetic appeal to stamped concrete, they will however last a lot longer and will never peel, flake or delaminate.Acrylic sealers consist of large particles suspended in either a solvent or water. When applied to your concrete, the acrylic particles will not penetrate into the concrete through the pores on the surface, because the particles will be too large. Instead, the particles will pool on top of the concrete creating a protective barrier. Once properly applied, an acrylic sealer will cover the entire surface of the concrete, acting as a sort of raincoat for your surfaces. Rather than react chemically with the chemicals and minerals within the concrete, as a penetrating sealer will do, acrylic sealers will simply protect the surface of your concrete.Ghostshield offers the Cryli-Tek 5500 which is a water based acrylic if you are looking for a low sheen finish or the Cryli-Tek 5505 if you are looking for a high gloss, wet look finish. Penetrating sealers are excellent choices if you are looking for the longest lasting protection and if you are looking for deicing salt protection on driveways, walkways and patios. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 will last upwards of ten years before needing to be reapplied.

Best Concrete Sealer for Driveways


						
							
							
								
								Driveways are one of the first aspects of your home seen by visitors or even just those driving around the block. Most driveways, especially in warmer areas without yearly snows, are made of concrete or concrete pavers, as opposed to asphalt which handles the freeze/thaw cycle better than untreated concrete. If you own a home in a warmer climate, or even if you own a home in a colder climate that already has a concrete driveway, you should treat your driveway with a concrete sealer to protect your concrete and ensure its strength and durability.Concrete sealers will help to restore your concrete, protecting it from water, salt, UV radiation, and other such harmful aspects of environmental conditions. An untreated concrete driveway will crack and discolor, allowing weeds and grass to grow up through the cracks, making your home look far worse by association. Fortunately, the fix for such problems is cost effective and easy to apply. A quality concrete sealer will ensure lasting protection for your concrete.If you live in an area of the country that uses deicing salts on the roadways the best product to use is a silane/siloxane sealer like the Siloxa-Tek 8500. The 8500 is able to resist spalling, pitting and cracking from harmful deicing salts and chlorides used on the roadways as well as prevent damage cause by freeze-thaw cycles. If you are looking for deicing salt protection as well as oil, grease  and staining protection (ie: leaves) the best product to use is the Siloxa-Tek 8505 (water based) Siloxa-Tek 8510 (solvent based). If you live in a warmer climate with no freeze-thaw cycles and no deicing salts you can use the Lithi-Tek 9500 for waterproofing, mold, mildew and efflorescence protection. If you are looking for a decorative finish use the Cryli-Tek 5500 for a low sheen or the Cryli-Tek 5505 for a high gloss finish.

How to Prevent Concrete Dusting


						
							
							
								
								Concrete dusting is a nuisance for the visual appearance of your concrete. While it will not harm the structural integrity of your foundations, basements, or other concrete surfaces, concrete dusting can require a lot of cleaning while making everything look dingy and uncared for.Concrete dusting is usually due to poorly cured concrete. Concrete gains much of its famous strength through a process known as concrete curing. After the aggregate, water, and Portland cement are mixed together, the new concrete sets and must be kept at a certain level of temperature and moisture in order for it to cure properly. Without a consistent temperature and moisture level, the concrete will not cure to the full potential of its strength. Poorly cured concrete can also lead to undesirable conditions like concrete dusting.Concrete dusting is usually a chalky white or gray dust coloring over the natural gray of concrete, leading to an unpleasant visual facade for your concrete. The easiest way to deal with concrete dusting is to cure your concrete properly. Unfortunately, you likely are not actually overseeing the curing process; its even likely that youre living in a home whose concrete has been poured and cured long ago. Fortunately, there is still an easy and cost-effective way to help reduce and remove concrete dusting without repouring and recuring the concrete.Concrete sealers are a great option for the homeowner, contractor, or other concrete owner faced with concrete dusting. The best product to use is more of a coating than a sealer since a concrete coating will be able to lock in the dust and completely stop the concrete from dusting altogether. If you are looking for an extremely durable option you could use the Epoxy 325 primer followed by the Urethane 645 top coat. Before using the epoxy and urethane we do recommend acid etching the concrete or mechanically scarifying the concrete prior to applying the coatings. If you are looking for a product that requires less surface preparation, The Cryli-Tek 5505 and Cryli-Tek 5500 products can also be used  although they will need to be reapplied more frequently.

How to Stop Basement Wall Seepage


						
							
							
								
								Basements and cellars are often the weakest spots in a house, leaving our homes open to damage from moisture, harmful gases, and other various ills. They often smell musty, as moisture seeps in through the floors or walls to pool and stagnate. We often store our valuables in our basements, leaving antiques, collections, and furniture sitting down there to save space in our homes. Water seeping through the basement walls could irreparably damage your homes foundation, as well as the various items stored in the basement.As most basements are made of poured concrete, the chances of water seepage through the walls are great. This is especially true if the walls have not been treated with a concrete sealer. Concrete, while strong and durable, is filled with a large number of extremely small pores that are natural to its creation. The various materials and compounds within the concrete react together, leaving a number of small air bubbles throughout the material.These small air bubbles, though harmless to the concrete, can allow water and gases to travel through the material. The best way to take care of this issue is to prevent it in order to defend against it. Using a quality concrete sealer is integral to the strength of your concrete and the safety of your home. For basement walls, the best choice in concrete sealers is a silicate/siliconate-based solution.However, if there is the potential for water seepage in through a crack in the walls you need to seal the crack first using a concrete crack sealer. This step, while effective, will not stop the problem from recurring on its own. In order to stop future water issues in your basement, you must use a waterproofing silicate/siliconate-based sealer, such as Lithi-Tek 9500. These sealers will penetrate through the pores of the concrete, react chemically within the material to densify and strengthen the concrete while helping prevent water damage that could lead to such problems as the build-up of mold and mildew.

Best Sealer for Concrete Parking Lots


						
							
							
								
								Parking lots are important to any commercial business, big or small. Not only is it a visual indicator that makes your business seem more or less successful, but it is important practically to the day-to-day operations of your building and businesses. Depending on the climate where you live, as well as the type of business you are, your parking lot will either be asphalt, concrete, or pavers. In colder climes, asphalt is preferred, as it handles freeze/thaw cycles better than untreated concrete.In warmer places without harsh winters, concrete is the preferred paving method for parking lots. They require less maintenance than asphalt, all while being less expensive to install than pavers. However, in order for your parking lot to last, it is important to take proper care of your lot by sealing it with an appropriate and quality concrete sealer.With proper sealing, cleaning and maintaining a parking lot is significantly easier and less costly. Sealants will even reduce freeze/thaw damage, making a concrete lot more cost effective for a moderately cold climate. The concrete of your parking lot will go through a lot of wear and tear over the course of its life, and without a proper coat of concrete sealer, you will have to patch it frequently. A patched parking lot does not create a pleasant visual appeal to your building, looking instead rather haphazard and uncared for.The best way to avoid this is by using concrete sealer, which will protect your concrete lot from weather damage, stains, spills, and various other problems caused by vehicles. This is especially true for parking lots with heavy traffic or with frequent traffic by heavy vehicles, which can lead to serious cracking and staining.The best choice for sealing your concrete parking lot is a penetrating silane/siloxane sealer, such as Siloxa-Tek 8510. The Siloxa-Tek 8510 will penetrate past the surface pores of the concrete to impregnate the concrete itself. The sealer will close up the air pockets within the material, leading to a deep and lasting protection from the weather, road salt, oil and other vehicle stains, and heavy use. With the Siloxa-Tek 8510, any water from rain or snowmelt, as well as any liquid stains, will bead on the surface of the concrete you will be able to see it working with your own eyes, helping give you peace of mind when it comes to your concrete parking lot.

Solvent-Based Acrylic Sealers


						
							
							
								
								If you have concrete in your home  such as a garage floor, basement walls, or roof tiles  you know that you need to seal these surfaces in order to protect them and ensure they last as long as they can. There are two basic types of concrete sealers on the market today: acrylic and penetrating.Penetrating sealers are good for certain types of concrete, as they penetrate deep within the surface of the material to block out water and various other potential harms. The penetrating solutions consist of small particles of sealant (typically a silicate, or a silane/siloxane) suspended in some sort of vessel (such as sodium or lithium) that will transport the sealant particles through the surface pores into the concrete. Once in the concrete, the particles will react chemically to fill the air bubbles and protect the concrete from moisture damage.Acrylic sealers, on the other hand, are substances that will not penetrate the surface. They will instead form a protective film on the surface of the concrete, helping to protect the concrete by making it water resistant. Its almost as if you have put a raincoat on the concrete  any good acrylic sealer will cause the water to bead and roll off your concrete. The acrylic sealer mixture consists of larger particles than penetrating sealers. The larger particles will not fit through the surface pores to penetrate into the concrete, instead pooling on the surface to be brushed out evenly to protect your material. Acrylic sealers tend to be less expensive and better for most aesthetically delicate concrete, such as decorative concrete. If there is no danger of water seepage through the bottom of the concrete, then acrylic sealers are a great choice.Once you've decided on an acrylic sealer instead of a penetrating sealer, you must choose between a solvent- or water-based acrylic sealer. The water-based sealers will not last quite as long as a solvent-based sealer, but they tend to have lower VOC content, which may make them the only choice in such states as California with strict environmental regulations. If you decide on the solvent-based sealer, it is important to remember that you must apply it in a well-ventilated area, as the fumes can be harmful to your health. Similarly, the solvent-based acrylic sealer will darken the surface of your concrete, resulting in a healthy glisten  if you prefer a more muted, matte finish to your concrete, it may be better to consider a water-based acrylic sealer.Cryli-Tek 5505 is a solvent-based acrylic sealer that actually meets all VOC regulations, making it a great fit for those who want the solvent-based option. However, if you prefer a water-based acrylic sealer, the Cryli-Tek 5500 is an excellent option.

How to Stop Concrete Floor Seepage


						
							
								Concrete floor seepage occurs primarily when there is a large amount of hydrostatic pressure beneath the floor of your home. Continue reading to learn how to stop concrete floor seepage and how to keep a basement or concrete floor dry.
							
								
								What causes concrete floor seepage?When it rains, water is absorbed into the ground until the earth is too saturated to soak up any more water. At this point, the water will begin to rise to the surface, causing hydrostatic pressure to build up against your foundation and basement floors, which leads directly to water seepage into your home. How to fix concrete floor seepage:In order to fix concrete floor seepage, you must first locate where the water is coming from; the floor, a cold seam or a crack. Once you've discovered the source of the leak, you need to repair any cracks with a concrete crack repair kit and seal the cold seam with a cold seam sealer. Lastly, seal the floor with a waterproofing concrete floor sealer.In order to determine the moisture vapor emission of your concrete perform a calcium chloride test.
								Why Ghostshield?
								The VAPOR-TEK 440 helps effectively reduce moisture vapor transmission to ensure protection of moisture sensitive floor coverings. The high performance and quick installation features of this system make it an ideal solution to stop concrete floor seepage while meeting ASTM F3010 for vapor permeance. The Vapor-Tek 440 will reduce moisture vapor emission rates of up to 20lb. / 24 hr / 1,000 ft. prior to the application of flooring. If your concrete has never had a moisture or dampness problem and you are looking for a preventative, cost-effective solution, use the LITHI-TEK 9500.

Epoxy Floor Systems


						
							
							
								
								While concrete can last virtually forever, there is no guarantee that the surface of the material will remain visually appealing. If you own a piece of property whose floors are subjected to heavy traffic, then you know firsthand the damage from wear-and-tear concrete can suffer. If youve been to an older parking garage, youve seen the faded arrows on the discolored floors guiding you through the structure. Concrete, while durable and strong, is not immune to aesthetic surface damage that comes from heavy traffic without proper protective measures.The best way to protect your concrete floors in high-traffic places, especially if there is already pre-existing damage, is to use epoxy floor systems. An epoxy broadcast system is an easy and effective way of creating an attractive, easy-to-maintain surface for your concrete floors, especially in warehouses, industrial or commercial buildings, retailers, airplane hangars, and other large, heavily trafficked places.The system itself consists of a primer coat, a high-build coat, and a topcoat on top of the concrete substrate. The primer and high-build coats are typically epoxy solutions, while the topcoat tends to be a polyurethane sealer. The process, while important to proactively protecting your concrete floors, is also a great option for restoring and repairing prior damage marring the surfaces. If you have rough floors, you should use a high-build solution (typically 18-36 mils) that will hide track marks, spalls, and other concrete imperfections.If you want to brighten your concrete, you can use an epoxy broadcast system to restore color to your floors. Similarly, the epoxy broadcast system can be used to seal paint chips or decorative quartz to create either a specific shape (i.e. an arrow in a parking garage) or a general covering of color or quartz. The paint chips or decorative quartz will be sealed with the high-build coating, under the polyurethane topcoat. This ensures that the color and form of your floors will remain high-quality and bright.A high build epoxy floor system is a great option for repairing, protecting, and preserving your heavily trafficked concrete floors. The system consists of a primer coat (Epoxy 325), a high-build coat (2nd coat of Epoxy 325), and a topcoat (Urethane 645 ). All of these materials will combine to create a surface that is both visually appealing and functional, ensuring your floor remains protected.

Epoxy Garage Sealers


						
							
							
								
								If you have a garage, you know how important of a space it is, serving as cover for our vehicles, workshops, sports equipment, and various other knickknacks we collect over the course of our lives. In theory, a concrete garage floor should last forever with little upkeep. However, in practice they are often not continually protected after their initial installation, leading to premature structural and aesthetic damage that can require costly repairs. The easiest solution to prevent anything from harming your garage floor is to seal the concrete.There are a number of different concrete sealing options for your garage floor. Many of those options, such as penetrating sealers and acrylic products are talked about on this website with GHOSTSHIELD products to do the job. One of the most cost-effective solutions to sealing your concrete garage floor is an epoxy sealer. Epoxy sealers are primarily a topical sealing option, as opposed to a penetrating sealer that goes past the surface to physically seal the air bubbles within the concrete. Epoxy sealers are the better choice for the harried homeowner without costing too much money.An epoxy sealer is typically made up of two components mixed together. The chemical bonding process results in a thicker and more durable material that can last for many years with only one applied coat. Compare this to a traditional acrylic sealer that only will last around a year and will not necessarily protect against stains from oil and vehicle fluids. An epoxy sealer is a water-resistant product featuring an abrasion-resistant finish that protects against road salt, stains, and hot tire pick up. In addition to all of the structural protection, epoxy sealers are frequently used to update the look of your garage floor, improving the color and texture of the floors surface.Ghostshield offers a few epoxy-based sealing options for garages. The first, Epoxy 325, is a water-based epoxy primer and coating that offers protection rivaling solvent-based epoxies. After applying the Epoxy 325 the Urethane 645 is recommended as a topcoat for increased abrasion resistance, chemical resistance and acid resistance.

Polyaspartic Coatings


						
							
							
								
								As a relative newcomer to the concrete protection scene, polyaspartics are fast becoming a popular option for home and business owners, contractors, and anyone else wanting to protect their concrete. While much of the information found on the Internet about polyaspartics features complicated technical language that is difficult to understand, polyaspartics are basically a polymer-based coating material used to protect concrete surfaces. Polyaspartics are a type of polyurea, which means they are a two-part system in which a resin is mixed with a catalyst to cause a curing reaction that hardens the material. Traditionally, polyureas have been difficult and complicated to apply, as their short pot-life of around 3-5 seconds meant the two materials had to be mixed immediately to ensure hardening. However, polyaspartics represent an evolution in technology with a longer pot-life, rapid curing, and other such benefits.The benefits of polyaspartics make the material ideal for many tougher sealing jobs. They can be applied at nearly any temperature, easily bonding to the concrete surface and curing to full strength from 30-60 minutes. Offering superior stain resistance and thorough UV protection, polyaspartics can withstand high temperatures without showing any signs of damage or coloring. Industrially, polyaspartics are widely used on bridges, protecting those structures from corrosion, UV radiation, and a general weakening of the concrete.Polyaspartics are just as effective for more typical daily tasks as well. They are an excellent choice for protecting concrete garage floors as they are anti-abrasive, fast-curing, and highly resistant to stains from liquids such as oil. Kitchen countertops are another ideal place to use polyaspartics, as they are resistant to even highly acidic liquids like lemon juice or red wine while protecting the countertops from high heat. All of these benefits, especially the anti-abrasion and fast application, make polyaspartics equally suited for commercial floors. More and more contractors are opting to use polyaspartics for commercial floors, applying the product that will be ready for heavy foot-traffic within hours.Polyaspartic 745 is an excellent option for someone looking for all the benefits of a good polyaspartic sealer.

Decorative Concrete Sealers


						
							
							
								
								What is decorative concrete?Decorative concrete is a specialty within concrete construction where skilled contractors employ creative methods of finishing existing or new concrete with stains, colors, designs, textures and patterns that make it more aesthetically appealing when it is visible.What is the best sealer for decorative concrete?The best concrete sealer for decorative surfaces are acrylic based sealers. Acrylic concrete sealers are either solvent based or water based. Solvent based acrylic sealers usually are better sealers than water based acrylics since they leave a high gloss shine and wear stronger and longer. Water based acrylics are recommended if you do not want a strong solvent odor or if you need a sealer with low VOCs, or live in a state like California. Solvent-based acrylics are best for exterior applications and water based acrylic sealers are best for interior applications. The best acrylic sealers are UV resistant and non-yellowing. Beware of high gloss solvent-based acrylic sealers that can become slippery when wet. Some manufacturers will offer customers non-slip additives to prevent slippery surfaces. Acrylic concrete sealers are the best sealers to use on decorative concrete to protect the surface and enhance the color. They are fast drying sealers usually drying within an hour. You can apply Cryli-Tek 5505, a solvent based sealer to leave a decorative glossy finish and to add extra protection again water and chloride intrusion, or you can apply Cryli-Tek 5500 a water based sealer, to leave a matte finish to leave a subtle satin sheet and to protect against water. If you are looking for the longest lasting sealer that does not have to reapplied for up to ten years it is best to use a penetrating sealer such as the Siloxa-Tek 8500. Although it will not change the look or appearance of the concrete, it will protect the concrete from water, salts and organic growth.

How to Seal a Basement


						
							
							
								
								Homeowners across the county are experiencing continuous water problems in their basements. Water damage can be attributed to a number of factors including the proximity of the homes foundation to the water table, the slope of the foundations ground, cracks in the foundation or weak concrete that allows water to seep through the walls. In order to prevent all of these problems it is best to use an all in one concrete sealer that is a combination densifier and waterproofer. First all cracks must be repaired by using a do-it-yourself crack repair kit or by hiring a professional crack repair specialist. Once you are sure water is not coming into the basement through cracks you can seal your basement with a basement waterproofing sealer. The best all in one sealer for basement waterproofing is Lithi-Tek 9500. It is a penetrating formula designed chemically react in the concrete filling the small pores, capillary tracts, and shrinkage cracks preventing the growth of mold and mildew and the spread of radon. Efflorescence and hydrostatic pressure are also reduced and concrete is strengthened up to 45%. Since Lithi-Tek 9500 is a densifier it will strengthen the concrete preventing water from seeping through the walls. Also because Lithi-Tek 9500 is a silicate/siliconate blend it has enhanced waterproofing characteristics and is the perfect sealer for basement waterproofing.

Best Sealer for Stucco


						
							
							
								
								Stucco is a material made of Portland cement plaster that is applied to an interior or exterior building surface. It is a strong, hard, fire-resistant material that is breathable allowing moisture vapor to escape. Stucco buildings are commonly found in warmer climates and locations like Florida and Texas. If you live in these areas a silane/siloxane based sealer is going to be your best option. A silane/siloxane based sealer is a water repellent that will penetrate and cause water to bead off of the surface.The best sealer for stucco is the Siloxa-Tek 8500. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 is an excellent product for sealing stucco since it is also a salt repellent sealer, meaning if you live in a tropical environment with salts in the air the sealer will protect from cracking, spalling and pitting. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 will last up to 10 years before another application is required and since it is a natural finish product the sealer will never wear away, fade, yellow, crack or peel. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 must be applied to stucco that has never been painted; however, after applying the Siloxa-Tek 8500 you can paint over the sealer with an oil or enamel based paint.

Best Sealer for Foundations


						
							
							
								
								One of the most important aspects of your home is the foundation. Without a solid foundation, unharmed by mold, mildew, and water damage, a house would not be a house. Accordingly, the best building material in human history, concrete, is used in almost all basements as the primary foundation material. Concrete is nigh indestructible, and can hypothetically last for close to 50,000 years, long after you'd have any use of your basement. However, it is not guaranteed to last that long if proper care isn't taken by you, the homeowner.The biggest danger to your homes concrete is water damage. Water seepage occurs because concrete is not a completely solid substance. Rather, it is created from a mixture of cement, water, and crushed stone that chemically react together to form crystals that interlock, giving the finished concrete material its strength. However, air bubbles are inherent in concrete, a natural part of the mixing process. These air pockets would not be an issue in a weatherless vacuum, but since homes do not exist in such circumstances, the pockets are a vulnerability in your houses otherwise strong concrete foundation.Water can seep into the concrete from any number of sources: rain, snow melt, flooding, an underground water table, etc. The important question is what to do when water enters the concrete. The short answer is that there is nothing really one can do at this point.  The mold and mildew must be cleaned periodically, and one must hope that the water doesnt freeze. While mold and mildew are problems, they are minor compared the danger posed by freezing water. Water that seeps into concrete only to freeze during the winter can destroy the concrete from within, ruining the structural integrity and causing the material to crumble, which could potentially bring your home down with it. Once the water has entered, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to get it out.Therefore, the only option to protecting your concrete is by sealing it as soon as you can. Concrete sealers are products that react chemically when applied to the concrete. Many of them penetrate deeply within the material, locking out water and other unwanted intrusions through their chemical reactions. For an interior concrete structure, such as a basements walls, floors, or foundations, a lithium silicate- and siliconate-based blend like  Lithi-Tek 9500 is optimal.The Lithi-Tek 9500 formula is designed to permanently waterproof and strengthen concrete by penetrating past the concretes surface. Instead of merely sitting on top of the surface, Lithi-Tek 9500 actually delves deep into the concrete, ensuring water is locked out and the concrete is as strong as it can be. The chemical particles within the sealer react with the chemicals naturally found within the concrete to form C-S-H (calcium-silicate-hydrate), which further increases the materials strength by filling in the air pockets through a process of impenetrable crystallization. After applying Lithi-Tek 9500, there are no pathways for the water to seep into the concrete, helping prevent mold, mildew, and the threat posed by freezing water.Finally, as the Lithi-Tek 9500 is water-soluble, it is safe for use indoors. The Lithi-Tek 9500 sealer is a cost-effective, odorless, non-toxic concrete sealer that is perfect for use in indoor spaces, like basements, to protect your house from the elements, ensuring your concrete remains strong and supportive.

Best Sealer for Driveways


						
							
							
								
								While much hype is made about protecting your interior concrete structures, such as basement walls, from damage, there needs to be an equal emphasis on your exterior ones. Driveways, for instance, are typically made of concrete and are one of the most important concrete structures to protect. Without the application of a good concrete sealer, suitable to the type of driveway you have, the concrete path will crack, stain, and weather poorly as it is constantly exposed to the elements.Exterior concrete comes in a number of different types, making its protective options vary significantly. As driveways are the biggest category of exterior surfaces, we will spend primarily address their protection, though all of our suggestions can work for any other exterior concrete surfaces.Driveways tend to either be made from gravel/dirt, brick pavers, or concrete. The first option cannot be sealed, as it is not concrete. However, the latter two are important to protect if you dont want to have to replace your driveway after only a short period of time. If you have a traditional concrete driveway and live in a colder climate with regular to heavy snow in the winter, you should use a silane/siloxane blended sealer, such as Siloxa-Tek 8500. In the winter most roads are plowed and salted regularly, with that salt becoming a permanent feature of your car and its tires. It is better to use a product like Siloxa-Tek 8500 that will block out the salt, protect the concrete from freeze-thaw cycles and prevent organic growth. If you are looking for additional added protect from staining of leaves, oils and grease the best products to use would be the Siloxa-Tek 8505 (water based) or the Siloxa-Tek 8510 (solvent based).If you have a traditional concrete driveway and you live in a warmer climate where it is unlikely or uncommon to find snow, you can use the Lithi-Tek 9500. The 9500 offers the best level of penetrative protection from such problems as water solubility (water will bead off the surface) and other forms of weathering, and it will not scratch or peel off over time.

The Best Concrete Densifiers


						
							
							
								
								While concrete is a notably hard and durable material, you can take steps to improve the material and extend its lifespan. One of the most common methods of doing this is by using concrete densifiers. Densifiers tend to consist of a silicate which will chemically react with the calcium hydroxide that makes up concrete, filling the empty spaces with a chemical compound (C-S-H, or calcium-silicate-hydrates) that serves to densify the material and alleviate the problematic dusting phenomenon. This process is remarkably similar to how concrete is produced in the first place; thus, it is a good precautionary measure to take to improve the life of your concrete.A good concrete densifier will penetrate the surface of the concrete increasing the strength and hardness by up to 50%. It is best to use a lithium silicate densifier like the Lithi-Tek 4500 since the lithium densifiers have a smaller particle size it allows them to penetrate deeper into the concrete. If you are going to be polishing the concrete you would first apply a densifier. If you are looking for waterproofing protection it is best to first apply the Lithi-Tek 4500 wait seven days and apply a topcoat such as the Siloxa-Tek 8500 or the Lithi-Tek 9500.

The Best Cinderblock Sealers


						
							
							
								
								Building with cinderblocks has become less and less popular over the past few years. Once the typical material used in basements, newer homes and buildings are increasingly built with poured concrete. However, if you have an older building, you likely have a basement constructed primarily with cinderblocks.One of the biggest drawbacks to cinderblocks is their perceptibility to moisture and water seepage. Because they are so porous, water easily finds it way underneath the surface, sitting in the numerous air pockets to fester and eventually spawn mold, mildew, and other issues.The best way to prevent this type of problem is by sealing your cinderblocks. Cinderblocks are extremely porous materials, featuring small holes and air bubbles of many different sizes. A silane/siloxane-based sealer is a far better option for sealing cinderblock its blend of large and small particles, designed specifically for porous material, penetrate the surface and chemically react below the substrate to form a water-repellent barrier. As the barrier is actually below the surface, it cannot crack, peel, fade away, or yellow over time, ensuring that your cinderblock looks beautiful regardless of actual age.If you are looking for a sealer that is environmentally friendly and easy to apply, check out Siloxa-Tek 8500. Siloxa-Tek 8500 is a water-based silane/siloxane-based sealer that abides to EPA laws and helps protect from water seepage, mold, cracking, sun-damage, etc., all while being extremely easy to apply.

Water Based Acrylic Sealers


						
							
							
								
								Acrylic sealers are a good choice for those who want to seal such materials as concrete, masonry, and brick, protecting them from acids, oils, grease, salt, food stains, UV rays, and more. Contrary to what you may read elsewhere, acrylic sealers will not penetrate the surface of the material  rather, they will form a substantive protective film over the concrete. It may help to think of an acrylic sealer as a raincoat, not allowing water through to the clothing, skin, or hair underneath. The sealers similarly beautify decorative concrete, enhancing the colors while curing and sealing the material for a number of years with its breathable film.Water-based acrylic sealers are often a better choice than solvent-based sealers. Water-based simply means that the acrylic solids (the parts actually protecting the concrete) are suspended in water, rather than a chemical solvent, such as acetone or xylene. When applied to the concrete, the water spreads and eventually coagulates over the material, fixing the protective acrylic particles in place to repel the various weathering phenomena (e.g. rain, snow, sun, etc.).While water-based sealers may not last as long as solvent-based, they are a significantly lower-risk alternative compared to the chemical sealers. Water-based acrylic sealers can be applied outdoors or indoors, as there are no harmful fumes to threaten ones health. Solvent-based sealers can only be safely applied in well-ventilated areas; any other type of environment risks severely adverse effects to ones long-term health.Similarly, water-based sealers are not flammable, nor will they change the color of the material. Again, they can be applied indoors (for example, in basements) without worry of going up in flame  their convenience often justifies their shorter life of application. In contrast, not only are solvent-based sealers hazardous to ones health, but they can always ignite, even from a mere spark, if applied in a poorly ventilated area.If you have a project requiring a water-based acrylic sealer Cryli-Tek 5500 is a 100% acrylic formula that, when applied, results in a breathable film enhancing the concrete material to which it is applied. Simply clean the surface and easily roll or spray the sealer over the material for a durable finish that will keep the surface looking new for years to come.

How to Prevent Efflorescence


						
							
							
								
								The best course of action, of course, is trying to prevent efflorescence before it manifests itself all over your walls. As you cannot control the chemical additives in the building materials, the most effective method of prevention is by closing up the pathways and sealing out the water that would otherwise bring those salts to the surface. To do this, it is recommended that you treat your concrete walls with a concrete sealer (the specific type of sealer will vary depending on the material of your walls,  check out Ghostshield's line of concrete sealers). A good concrete sealer will serve to penetrate the concrete, both keeping out water while simultaneously sealing up the aforementioned pathways to the surface.However, if you've purchased a new home only to realize that efflorescence is already an issue, use the Hydro-Etch 1000, specially designed to clear up efflorescence and etch concrete, washing away the built-up salts to leave your walls unmarked. Even if you successfully clean away the efflorescence, it is important to deal with the underlying issue; if you do not seal up your wall with an effective concrete sealer, the salts will simply build up again in the future, necessitating further cleaning and eventually threatening to deteriorate your concrete, leaving your home susceptible to mold, mildew, and other such issues.

What is Efflorescence?


						
							
							
								
								Picture this: you have just moved into a new house, your dream home with all the space, yard, and garage space you could hope for. You have this beautiful half-finished basement, of which the other half is exposed concrete: stark and plain, but clean. You spend a couple months organizing and unpacking, and everything is going well, you're really starting to feel at home. One day, however, as you venture into the unfinished part of the basement to find that old screwdriver you know you didnt forget in the move, you are confronted with this white gunk marring your grey concrete walls.This buildup is nothing more than efflorescence, an annoying and ugly  yet ultimately harmless affliction that plagues concrete and brick materials. The phenomenon itself is due to water leaking to the surface of the concrete or brick material, carrying salts that are otherwise locked beneath the surface. The water travels through various pathways within the concrete, bringing along salts that it deposits on the surface before evaporating. After the water evaporates, it leaves behind the salts, which harden into the white gunk that you are currently faced with.There are three necessary conditions for efflorescence to occur: there must be salts and other chemical additives within the actual material, there must be water leakage into the concrete to bring out the salts, and there must be pathways for the water/salt mixture to travel to the surface. These three conditions are almost impossible to prevent entirely, as you cannot know, for instance, if there are any salts and/or chemical additives within your concrete.And while efflorescence is harmless, being more of an aesthetic matter rather than posing any structural danger, it is an indicator of an even bigger issue: water leakage within your concrete, a problem that can lead to other, more serious issues such as mold, mildew, and general deterioration of the material.In order to remove efflorescene use the Hydro-Etch 1000, a powerful, acid-based cleaner, specifically formulated to clean, brighten and etch concrete in addition to removing efflorescence and excess concrete residue.

History of Concrete


						
							
							
								
								Concrete is one of the most important creations in the history of human civilization, on par with language and writing. Created in 500 B.C., the material has since been used in almost all building projects across all continents and civilizations  in fact, concrete is the most common man-made material on earth, with an average of almost three tons of material used annually for every human being. However, it is often just a background feature of our daily lives, providing structure and support to the buildings, roads, and bridges we rely on.At its most basic level, it is a composite material created from a mixture of aggregate (crushed stone and sand), cement, and water. While many may think of concrete and cement as interchangeable terms, they are, in fact, different materials altogether  cement is merely one of the ingredients used to make concrete. The aggregate of concrete, the crushed stone and sand, is typically created from limestone and granite, which greatly increases the strength of the concrete. The binding element is almost always cement, which chemically bonds with the aggregate to hold all of the disparate particles together.In order to create concrete, the aggregate is mixed with the cement and the water, forming a semi-liquid substance that can be poured and shaped as required. Then, through a chemical process called hydration, the substance becomes rock-solid after a short period of time, resulting in the strong material that we all know as concrete. Hydration itself is a process during which crystals are created that bind and interlock together, giving concrete its noted and crucial strength.Once concrete is created, there is little that can truly destroy it.  It can hypothetically even last 50,000 years, according to the Materials, Science, and Engineering Program at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. One of the biggest threats to concrete, however, is freezing water. As concrete is composed of aggregate bound together by cement, there are a number of small holes within the material. While these holes do not decrease the concretes strength, they leave the material susceptible to such problems as water leakage. When water seeps into the concrete, it threatens to cause such problems as the growth of mildew and mold. While these growths are an inconvenience, bringing up various issues with health and gradual damage, they will not destroy the concrete themselves. However, in colder climates, this threat is exacerbated as that water can freeze, ruining the structural integrity of the concrete, causing it to crumble.One of the best ways to protect your concrete, ensuring that the problems with mold, mildew, and the irreversible issue of freezing water do not harm your investment, is by using a Ghostshield Concrete Sealer. Concrete sealers come in a variety of different chemical strains, each designed specifically for the particular type of concrete material, climate, and situation. Without chemical reactions, concrete would not exist today. Therefore, when you think about sealing your concrete to protect it and lengthen its lifespan, you want to look for products that spark chemical reactions within the concrete. Many concrete sealer products have complicated chemical formulas associated with them, making them an inexpensive and smart investment to keep your driveways, basements, foundations, etc. free from damage.

Best Sealer for a Concrete Garage


						
							
							
								
								While choosing between exterior and interior concrete sealers may be straightforward, a garage floor may at first seem somewhat more difficult to determine. The garage is a kind of liminal space where the exterior and interior meet at a happy medium, necessitating a good concrete sealer to protect the floor.  Which route should you take?Your garage floor is likely made of concrete, one of the most durable materials on earth. However, it is also a material made up of crushed stone, cement, water, and air, all of which have bonded to form concrete. The negative to this mixture is the large number of tiny air bubbles that naturally occur in concrete; these air bubbles are what let oil and other vehicle leakages seep into the material, as well being what makes it so difficult to fully remove stains.In order to effectively protect your garage floor from stains, oil or otherwise, you need to seal your floor with a good concrete sealer. Concrete sealers help protect your concrete from natural elements, such as water damage.If you are looking for a natural finish garage floor sealers like Siloxa-Tek 8505 (water based) or Siloxa-Tek 8510 (solvent based) would be your best options. These sealers will improve protection not only at the topical level; since their larger particles offer a more comprehensive surface protection, the sealer will penetrate and provide protection from within. Both sealers are also deicing salt repellents so they will protect the garage from spalling, pitting and cracking. For oil stains, the key is to seal off the surface of the concrete, which they will do, greatly increasing the durability of the concrete surface. The surface protection will leave the oil pooled on top of the concrete for an easy clean up, rather than leaking into the pores of the concrete to leave a nasty stain.If you are looking for the most durable protection with a glossy finish use the Epoxy 325 primer followed by the Urethane 645 topcoat. The combiation of the two products will make a garage floor chemically resistant, oil and grease resistant, acid resistant and abrasion resistance.

Best Sealer for a Shop Floor


						
							
							
								
								One of the most frustrating moments in home ownership must be finding oil stains on your shop floor. However it happened, and regardless of who is to blame, the problem is almost irreversible  while there are a number of do-it-yourself home remedies, they only serve to help mitigate the stain, rather than erasing it completely. If you have an oil stain, it will likely remain there forever, even if it may only be a subtle shadow.Wouldn't it be better to take easy steps to prevent any oil stains in the first place? Your garage floor is likely made of concrete, one of the most durable materials on earth. However, it is also a material made up of crushed stone, cement, water, and air, all of which have bound to form concrete. The negative to this mixture is the large number of tiny air bubbles that naturally occur in concrete; these air bubbles are what let the oil seep into the material, as well being what makes it so difficult to fully remove stains.In order to effectively protect your garage floor from stains, oil or otherwise, you need to seal your floor with a good concrete sealer. Concrete sealers help protect your concrete from natural elements, such as water damage, as well as from inadvertent error, like the spilling of oil. However, as there are a number of different chemical formulas for concrete sealers, you want to find the product that best suits your needs: protection from oil stains.Silane/Siloxane blend sealers like Siloxa-Tek 8505 (water based) or Siloxa-Tek 8510 (solvent based) would be a good option for a concrete shop floor. The silane/siloxane has larger particles that offer a more comprehensive surface protection and these particular products are formulated with a proprietary fluropolymer to make them resistant to staining. However, an epoxy like the Epoxy 325 and a urethane topcoat like the Urethane 645 would be the best option if you are looking for an incredibly durable coating. The built up surface protection will leave the oil pooled on top of the concrete for an easy clean up, rather than leaking into the pores of the concrete to leave a nasty stain. They also make cleaning extremely easy and leave a beautiful gloss finish, available clear or colored.

Best Basement Sealer


						
							
							
								
								In order to figure out the best basement sealer for your concrete basement, we first must assess the situation: Are you currently experiencing active water seepage or water damage? If so, there are a few steps you need to take before you can begin to think about sealing your concrete.Where is the water coming from? If you notice the water is leaking from a crack, you must first seal the crack. Is it a horizontal or vertical crack? Is the leak coming from a seam or an expansion joint? Contact a concrete crack repair kit specialist or seal the crack yourself with a crack repair product.Once the crack is sealed a sealer can be applied to protect the concrete from future water damage. We recommend a sealer that can prevent vapor transmission and can resist hydrostatic pressure. Also the sealer should be able to prevent the growth of mold, mildew, efflorescence and dangerous radon gases. The best all in one basement sealer for preventatively sealing, meaning the basement does not have any active moisture issues, is the Lithi-Tek 9500. All the benefits and densifying properties of a silicate sealer with all of the waterproofing characteristics of a siliconate sealer. It is a chemically reactive sealer that fills all the pores and capillary voids creating a denser substrate to eliminate the transmission of water. Also, since it is a penetrating sealer, it penetrates deep into the slab and a chemical reaction occurs with the calcium and free lime in concrete. It hardens into a gel, filling all the pores of your concrete while still allowing it to breathe. This gel hardens and becomes a part of the concrete, creating a denser harder surface. Efflorescence, mold, mildew and radon are eliminated and water is prevented from damaging the basement.If the basement has experienced active moisture issues it is best to use a two step process. First use the Lithi-Tek 4500 as a primer, followed up with the Siloxa-Tek 8500 seven days later. The combination of the two products will help to prevent any future water or moisture from traveling through the concrete.

Best Brick Sealer


						
							
							
								
								What are bricks made of?Bricks are created by using water, clay and shale. The mixture is left to dry naturally, away from direct sunlight. They can also be artificially hardened by burning the bricks by putting them in kilns somewhere between 1000 and 1200.What is a brick sealer?Brick sealers are water repellents that are specifically designed to be used on brick surfaces.Brick sealers are especially formulated to:Seal and protect from UV exposureRepel waterSolidify the jointing mortar in between the individual bricksSo what is the best brick sealer?Bricks are hard and dense yet porous and easily penetrated by water. To maintain the natural bricks look and protect them from water and salt attack, it is important to use a high quality, invisible, impregnating sealer. We recommend a water based silane/siloxane sealer due to low VOC content. (Please note there are currently 16 states in the US that restrict solvent-based sealers.) Silane/Siloxane sealers like Siloxa-Tek 8500 are milky white in liquid form but they dry clear.Benefits of using a silane/siloxane on bricks: You can easily apply with a garden type pump sprayerWill penetrate better into the substrate and mortar jointsPrevents the growth of mold, mildrew and effloresceneAfter sealing water will bead off the surface

How to Remove Paint From Concrete


						
							
							
								
								Before applying a Ghostshield concrete sealer, the surface must be free of all paint and surface coatings. Below are the instructions on how to remove paint from concrete.Prepare the surface of the concrete by removing all debris and dirt. Use a brush or scraper to remove any loose paint from the concrete.Depending on the type of paint you are trying to remove, apply a water-based or oil- based paint stripper to the concrete.Follow the manufacturers instructions to see how long you need to leave the stripper on the concrete.Use a wire brush or scraper to remove the newly loosened paint. A pressure washer can also be used on outdoor surfaces.If paint is still on the surface a floor grinder or sandblaster may need to be used. Please note that using a floor grinder or sandblaster can remove the top layer of concrete resulting in surface damage.Repeat the process if necessary. A few applications of paint stripper may be need to remove the paint from the concrete.After all paint is removed, clean the surface with a power washer to remove all of the paint stripper and make sure the surface is dry before sealing the surface with a Ghostshield Concrete Sealer.

How to Prevent Concrete from Cracking


						
							
							
								
								Contrary to popular belief, concrete is extremely porous. While it is very hard, it also has millions of tiny pores and microscopic cracks. Looking at concrete under magnification reveals the pore and capillary structure.  It is remarkable how many tiny voids there are. There are a number of ways that concrete gets destroyed and damaged but the most common reasons are de-icing salts and freeze/thaw cycles.<When salt and water get in concretes pores, the breakdown begins. Salt gets carried into the pores of the concrete by water and creates an acidic-like reaction inside the concrete, eating away the bonds in the cement portion of the concrete, and creating larger voids that attract more water and salt. Salt is hydroscopic, which means that it attracts water, up to 10% more water in the same space. Water is the real catalyst of damage. Salt just makes it easier for water to get into the pores and capillaries of concrete.When water gets absorbed into the pores, it can expand up to 9% when it freezes. This pressure creates cracks and larger voids in the interior structure of the concrete, creating larger pathways for water and chemical intrusion. Sooner or later, the pressure from freezing water will pop the surface of the concrete, exposing the aggregate, and creating an unattractive look and a potential safety issue.The key to protecting your concrete is to seal with a Ghostshield penetrating concrete sealer like Siloxa-Tek 8500 to permanently prevent salts and water from entering the concrete.

How to Polish Concrete


						
							
							
								
								Polished concrete is becoming more popular in a wide variety of applications. It is often seen in retail and institutional environments for a clean, hygienic look and the ease of maintenance under high-traffic conditions. By choosing to leave the concrete exposed as a finish also eliminates the material and energy consumption associated with adding a floorcovering.The process of mechanically polishing concrete is like scratching the surface until the scratch patterns become too fine to see. To effectively polish concrete, it must be hard enough since the harder the concrete, the better it will take a polish. This is why before polishing we recommend sealing concrete with Lithi-Tek 4500. Densifiers like Lithi-Tek 4500 react with calcium hydroxide trapped in the concrete to form additional calcium silicate hydrate, filling the pores and increasing surface hardness. Lithi-Tek 4500 will react with the ingredients in concrete to densify while allowing deep penetration to chemically harden and fortify the substrate. After the chemical reaction occurs, the substrate will be more abrasion resistant and help protect the surface from wear, moisture and efflorescence while remaining breathable. Concrete, left untouched, presents a problem to polishing: The surface is usually not hard enough to polish especially since the surface is usually the softest layer. By applying a chemical densifier to concrete before polishing like Lithi-Tek 4500 this problem is solved.

How to Clean Concrete


						
							
							
								
								Before applying a sealer for the first time, you should clean the concrete. There are many ways to clean concrete before applying a sealer but we recommend removing all dirt and debris, power-washing and using an industrial strength concrete cleaner before sealing with a concrete sealer. In order to clean the concrete, we first recommend power washing. By power washing the concrete, it allows the sealer to penetrate deeper into the concrete. Be sure to power wash carefully since too much pressure can damage the concrete.If the concrete is still dirty after power washing, you can apply a cleaning chemical etcher that is specially formulated to clean concrete like Hydro-Etch 1000.While using Hydro-Etch 1000 follow the instructions, scrub the concrete and pay attention to noticeable stains.After cleaning, rinse the concrete again with the power washer. If stains persist, you can repeat the process.Wait at least 24 hours for the concrete to dry before applying a Ghostshield sealer.

How to Remove Efflorescence From Concrete


						
							
							
								
								Efflorescence is a crystalline deposit of excess salts that travel with moisture to the surface of concrete. It is whitish in appearance and is naturally occurring in all concrete. Water must be present to carry and move the salts to the surface, once the water evaporates a white hazy substance is left on the surface; this is efflorescence. The denser the concrete, the more difficult it is for salts to travel through the concrete. By sealing with a penetrating concrete sealer, concrete is hardened up to 45% and efflorescence is eliminated. Since humidity can affect efflorescence, it has been shown that it can be a seasonal problem with efflorescence being most common during rainy seasons. Common causes of efflorescence include the movement of groundwater; since hydrostatic pressure can force water and salts to move to the surface. Bricks are also common surfaces that have problems with efflorescence and the combination of a brick and a certain type of mortar may result in increased salt deposits.Efflorescence must be removed before applying a penetrating sealer. To remove efflorescence before applying a sealer we first recommend scrubbing the surface with a wire brush and water. If that does not work we recommend acid removal. Acid removal includes using Hydro-Etch 1000 on the efflorescence. (Please note Hydro-Etch 1000 must be diluted before use. Read all label instructions before application and wear the proper safety gear when applying.) After etching, the concrete needs to be rinsed with water and neutralized with baking soda or household ammonia.

How to Remove Mold and Mildew from Concrete


						
							
								Before applying a concrete sealer, the surface must be free of all mold and mildew. Below are a few processes on how to remove mold and mildew from concrete. We recommend using a facemask and rubber gloves in order to avoid inhaling the mold and mildew.
							
								
								How to remove mold and mildew from concreteUse household bleach, one cup bleach to 1 gallon of water.ORMix 1 cup of vinegar with 2/3 cups of water in a sprayer bottle. In order to treat a larger surface double, triple, or quadruple the ratio and use a low pressure sprayer. Spray the mixture directly on the mold and mildew and wait 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, spray more and scrub gently with a sponge. You should begin to see the mold and mildew scrub off. If there is still additional mold and mildew, spray with the vinegar/water mixture and wait another 30 minutes before scrubbing and wiping away the mold and mildew.After moving all existing mold and mildew apply a penetrating concrete sealer to reduce future mold and mildew growth.
								Why Ghostshield?
								By using a penetrating concrete sealer like the SILXOA-TEK 8500 mold, mildew and organic growth will be reduced and made easier to clean. The Siloxa-Tek 8500 is our favorite product to treat nearly any application. A proprietary blend of silane/siloxanes, this clear penetrating sealer not only prevents deicing salt and freeze-thaw damage, but its hydrophobic nature resists moisture intrusion and vapor transmission. This is the go to choice to seal any concrete, brick, or masonry based substrate especially driveways, basements, patios and garages.

Concrete Densifiers and Hardeners


						
							
							
								
								What is a densifier?A densifier is substance applied to the surface of concrete in order to fill pores and increase surface density. They are chemical solutions designed to improve surface hardness, density and shine. They react with free lime and calcium hydroxide present in the concrete. This solidifies it, making the concrete surface much less permeable and more resistant to stains.Where is a densifier used?The most common uses include hard troweled industrial floors, polished concrete (before polishing) and decorative concrete (before being decoratively stained). Densifiers are also used prior to applying a hydrophobic sealer such as the Sloxa-Tek 8500 since they will increase the adhesion and performance of the 8500 product and make the concrete less permeable. Why is a densifer needed?Densification is the process of permanently closing pores in the top layer of the slab. Since concrete is extremely porous, it is susceptible to staining and vulnerable to acid attack that may cause surface etching. Surface wear and dusting are natural characteristics of concrete that need to be considered when deciding to seal concrete. Since concrete is weak, densifiers, hardeners, additives, and protectors are used to help resolve these issuesTypes of densifiers:Densifiers are classified into two generations. Magnesium, potassium and sodium silicate are first-generation products and react with the calcium hydroxide in the concrete. The reaction starts immediately but continues slowly, due to the natural closeness of the pH of concrete. This application process is more caustic and labor-intensive.Second-generation densifiers are lithium silicate-based densifiers with nano-sized technology and waterborne colloidal silica from nano-sized particles. The suspension of the silicate particles allows the solution to penetrate much deeper before this reaction takes place.How densifiers work: Lithi-Tek 4500 works by reacting with lime in concrete. During hydration, approximately 20 percent of a concrete mixtures Portland cement is converted to lime, which has no structural value in concrete. However,Lithi-Tek 4500 reacts with the lime to form calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) crystals, the same type of mineral compound that acts as the binder in concrete and imparts strength. Additional CSH fills the pores in concrete and increases the hardness and stain resistance of the surfaceConcrete pores are pathways created by migrating water and Lithi-Tek 4500 penetrates the slabs pore structure. Lithi-Tek 4500 is spray-applied and the concrete slab will be dry to walk or drive on in about 6 hours. Over time, ordinary foot traffic will burnish the hardened slab to a soft sheen. Lithi-Tek 4500 also helps resist wear and control dusting. Why densify before polishing concrete?Concrete must be between 5000 psi and 6000 psi strong to be polished without a densifier. Concrete that is weaker will not take a polish as well because very small particles of aggregate will pull out of the concrete matrix rather than being held firm to the surface during polishing. By first sealing with Lithi-Tek 4500, concrete is hardened over 5000 psi and you can easily polish concrete leaving the surface with a high sheen. Lithi-Tek 4500 will react with the ingredients in cement to densify while allowing deep penetration to chemically harden and fortify the substrate. After the chemical reaction occurs, the substrate will be more abrasion resistant and help protect the surface from wear, moisture and efflorescence while remaining breathable.

How to Acid Etch Concrete


						
							
							
								
								Acid is generally mixed at a ratio of 3 parts water to 1 part acid for sufficient strength to etch properly.  Ideally you want to test the strength needed first before doing the entire floor.  You can do this by first mixing a small solution in your watering can starting at a 5:1 ratio.  Apply it to a small area of wet concrete.  It should begin bubbling and fizzing immediately.  If not then you will want to increase the strength accordingly.  Sometimes a ratio stronger than 3:1 may be needed for particularly dense concrete or a smooth power troweled floor.Caution!  Always add acid to water, not water to acid.  If you pour water into acid it can cause an explosive reaction that can spray you with the mixture and burn your skin!Before acid etching, make sure the concrete is free of all oil, contaminants, grease, and dirt.  Contrary to what many people think, acid will not clean grease and oil spots.  In fact, if these areas have not been cleaned and degreased properly, the acid solution will just sit on top and not react with the concrete.Dampen the concrete: Use your hose to lightly spray down the concrete in your garage so that the concrete is wet but not puddling water.  If you have a large floor, you may want to acid etch in sections.  Do not let the concrete dry out before or during application of the acid solution.Apply the acid solution: Use the 2 gallon plastic watering container to sprinkle the acid solution on the concrete.  This will spread the solution evenly without much splashing.  Do not just pour it on the concrete.  This will create an inconsistent spread of the acid solution and will not provide for a uniform result.  The 2 gallon container works well because you can mix 1.5 gallons of water to .5 gallons of acid for a 3:1 ratio.  You can use any size you like however, as long as you mix the ratio of acid to water correctly.  1 gallon of acid solution will cover approximately 50 – 70 square feet of garage floor.Scrub the acid solution: Once the solution is applied, lightly scrub it into the concrete with a push broom or long handled scrub brush.  This helps to create a uniform etch of the concrete.  Let the solution sit from 2 – 15 minutes while it continues to fizz and bubble.  Do not let the floor dry out during this process.  Add more solution if necessary.Neutralize: Mix 4 cups of baking soda to 1 gallon of water in your large 5 gallon bucket and pour it into the now empty watering container. Or use 4 ounces of household ammonia to 1 gallon of water. Sprinkle your neutralizing solution over the part of the floor that was acid etched and let it sit for a minimum of 10 minutes.  When time is up, rinse the neutralized solution with your hose into a drain or out the garage (if local water codes allow it).  Another method is to use a wet vac and then dispose of the solution according to your local codes. Check the surface of the concrete at this time.  It should feel similar to medium grit sand paper with a uniform texture.  If not, you will need to repeat the process again.Final rinse: Once the initial neutralizing solution is cleaned up, it is important to thoroughly flush and rinse the remaining solution out of the concrete multiple times.  It can leave a white powdery residue on your floor once dried (called calcium carbonate) if you do not do this.  This is a fine dust that will not allow your coating to adhere properly.  Use a high pressure nozzle while thoroughly scrubbing the concrete with your scrub brush.  You can introduce a mild solution of Simple Green at this point if you like.  Just make sure it is thoroughly rinsed. Using a pressure washer at this point works well also.  Do not use a pressure washer to rinse off the initial neutralizing solution however.  It can drive any acid solution that had not been neutralized yet deeper into the concrete and cause problems later.pH test your rinse water: After your final rinse, dab a pH test strip onto the still wet floor to check the pH.  Anything between 6.0 and 9.0 will work for most coatings with 7.0 (neutral) being ideal.  If it’s below 6.0 then the water is indicating that acid residue is still in the pores of the concrete.  Rinse some more and repeat the test until you get the results you want.Further Tips for Acid Etching Concrete:It’s a good idea to cover anything that you don’t want to get splashed with a plastic drop cloth.  Don’t acid etch the concrete if the temps are below 50 degrees as the acid will not be as effective with the cooler temperatures. Also, make sure your floor has dried thoroughly before applying a concrete sealer.  Fans will help.  Give it at least two days with warm weather and longer if it’s humid or cooler.  Though the surface may be dry, the pores of the concrete can still contain moisture and escape through outgassing when the temperatures rise during the day.  This will cause your coating to not properly adhere.  You can always do a quick moisture test with plastic if you are not sure.
