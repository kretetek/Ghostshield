Need perspective? "Nano" means one-billionth. There are 25,400,000 nanometers in an inch. Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter at this tiny scale. A grain of sand, a component in concrete, is ~500,000 nanometers wide: miniscule, but Ghostshield particles are small enough to pass through it.
